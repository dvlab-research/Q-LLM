{"input": "Where does Harry Potter live before he goes to Hogwarts?", "answer": "He lives with the Dursleys at 4 Privet Drive.", "context": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\n\n\n\n\n\nJ. K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\nSay you\u2019ve spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J. K. Rowling\u2019s enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. In the nonmagic human world\u2014the world of \u201cMuggles\u201d\u2014Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he\u2019s quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley.\n\nA mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: \u201cWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, \u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig\u2026 and that\u2019s where the real adventure\u2014humorous, haunting, and suspenseful\u2014begins. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, first published in England as Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children\u2019s Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U. K. version of the Newbery Medal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jessica, who loves stories,\n\nFor Anne, who loved them too;\n\nAnd for Di, who heard this one first.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. THE BOY WHO LIVED\n\n\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n\n\u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar\u2014a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen\u2014then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive\u2014no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes\u2014the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt\u2014these people were obviously collecting for something\u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes, their son, Harry\u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking\u2026 no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her\u2014if he\u2019d had a sister like that\u2026 but all the same, those people in cloaks\u2026\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\u2014and it didn\u2019t improve his mood\u2014was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\n\u201cAnd finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early\u2014it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters\u2026\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr\u2014Petunia, dear\u2014you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n\u201cWell, I just thought\u2026 maybe\u2026 it was something to do with\u2026 you know\u2026 her crowd.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son\u2014he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did\u2026 if it got out that they were related to a pair of\u2014well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind\u2026 He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on\u2014he yawned and turned over\u2014it couldn\u2019t affect them\u2026\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\u2014the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\n\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n\u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no\u2014even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent\u2014I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense\u2014for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you haven\u2019t\u201d, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You Know\u2014oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re too\u2014well\u2014noble to use them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying,\u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are\u2014are\u2014that they\u2019re\u2014dead.\u201d\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\u201cLily and James\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to believe it\u2026 Oh, Albus\u2026\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u201cI know\u2026 I know\u2026\u201d he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potter\u2019s son, Harry. But\u2014he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke\u2014and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s true?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done\u2026 all the people he\u2019s killed\u2026 he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding\u2026 of all the things to stop him\u2026 but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may never know.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all places?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014you can\u2019t mean the people who live here?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore\u2014you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got this son\u2014I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous\u2014a legend\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future\u2014there will be books written about Harry\u2014every child in our world will know his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes\u2014yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2014wise\u2014to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky\u2014and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild\u2014long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir\u2014house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\u201cIs that where\u2014?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that scar forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well\u2014give him here, Hagrid\u2014we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cCould I\u2014could I say good bye to him, sir?\u201d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the Muggles!\u201d\n\n\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-can\u2019t stand it\u2014Lily an\u2019 James dead\u2014an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be takin\u2019 Sirius his bike back. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall\u2014Professor Dumbledore, sir.\u201d\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\n\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley\u2026 He couldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Potter\u2014the boy who lived!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE VANISHING GLASS\n\n\n\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets\u2014but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s birthday\u2014how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise\u2014unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask questions\u2014that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way\u2014all over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\u2014Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\n\u201cThirty six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, thirty seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\u201d\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty\u2026 thirty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction.\n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there\u2014or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug.\n\n\u201cWhat about what\u2019s her name, your friend\u2014Yvonne?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon.\n\n\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she snarled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026and leave him in the car\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying\u2014it had been years since he\u2019d really cried\u2014but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 want\u2026 him\u2026 t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang\u2014\u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically\u2014and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy\u2014any funny business, anything at all\u2014and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls)\u2014The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\n\n\u201c\u2026roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon\u2014they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can\u2014but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself\u2014no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see\u2014so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened\u2014one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come\u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo\u2014cupboard\u2014stay\u2014no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\n\n\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n\n\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it\u2014it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings\u2019 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High\u2014like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and\u2014a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives\u2014he didn\u2019t belong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\n\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\n\n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\n\n\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d said Dudley suddenly. \u201cDad, Harry\u2019s got something!\u201d\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness\u2014Vernon!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley.\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n\n\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address\u2014how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching\u2014spying\u2014might be following us,\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an answer\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s best\u2026 we won\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we swear when we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\u201d\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my cupboard on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, Harry\u2014about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking\u2026 you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it\u2026 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there\u2026 I need that room\u2026 make him get out\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cGo to your cupboard\u2014I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley\u2014go\u2014just go.\u201d\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat\u2014something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\n\u201cI want\u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno damn letters today\u2014\u201d\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one\u2014\n\n\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n\n\u201cShake \u2019em off\u2026 shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television programs he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering\u2026\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\n\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great Humberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u201d\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday\u2014and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television\u2014then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun\u2014last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.\n\n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds\u2026 twenty\u2026 ten\u2026 nine\u2014maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him\u2014three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\n\n\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cannon?\u201d he said stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands\u2014now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then\u2014\n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy journey\u2026\u201d\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n\n\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\n\u201cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are breaking and entering!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n\n\u201cAnyway\u2014Harry,\u201d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here\u2014I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u201d\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u2019s whole arm.\n\n\u201cWhat about that tea then, eh?\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together. \u201cI\u2019d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\u2019ve got it, mind.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath.\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n\u201cYer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019 anymore, Dursley, don\u2019 worry.\u201d\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\n\u201cCall me Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone does. An\u2019 like I told yeh, I\u2019m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts\u2014yeh\u2019ll know all about Hogwarts, o\u2019 course.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014no,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said quickly.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019 s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\u2019t gettin\u2019 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\u2019t even know abou\u2019 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll what?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cALL WHAT?\u201d Hagrid thundered. \u201cNow wait jus\u2019 one second!\u201d\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n\u201cDo you mean ter tell me,\u201d he growled at the Dursleys, \u201cthat this boy\u2014this boy!\u2014knows nothin\u2019 abou\u2019\u2014about ANYTHING?\u201d\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u201cI know some things,\u201d he said. \u201cI can, you know, do math and stuff.\u201d But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \u201cAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u2019 world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\n\u201cDURSLEY!\u201d he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \u201cMimblewimble.\u201d Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n\n\u201cBut yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re famous. You\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? My\u2014my mom and dad weren\u2019t famous, were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know\u2026 yeh don\u2019 know\u2026\u201d Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know what yeh are?\u201d he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he commanded. \u201cStop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\u201d\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\n\n\u201cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\u2019 you\u2019ve kept it from him all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cKept what from me?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\u201cAh, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry\u2014yer a wizard.\u201d\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d gasped Harry.\n\n\u201cA wizard, o\u2019 course,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \u201can\u2019 a thumpin\u2019 good\u2019un, I\u2019d say, once yeh\u2019ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\u2019 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\u2019 I reckon it\u2019s abou\u2019 time yeh read yer letter.\u201d\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut on the Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\n\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\u2019s head like fireworks and he couldn\u2019t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \u201cWhat does it mean, they await my owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cGallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl\u2014a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl\u2014a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going,\u201d he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry, interested.\n\n\u201cA Muggle,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cit\u2019s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\u2019 it\u2019s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\u2019 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe swore when we took him in we\u2019d put a stop to that rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cswore we\u2019d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou knew I\u2019m a\u2014a wizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew!\u201d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \u201cKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that\u2014that school\u2014and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was\u2014a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\u201d\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n\n\u201cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\u2019d be just the same, just as strange, just as\u2014as\u2014abnormal\u2014and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\u201d\n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \u201cBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\u201d\n\n\u201cCAR CRASH!\u201d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \u201cHow could a car crash kill Lily an\u2019 James Potter? It\u2019s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\u2019 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why? What happened?\u201d Harry asked urgently.\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\u2019s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\n\n\u201cI never expected this,\u201d he said, in a low, worried voice. \u201cI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\u2019 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\u2019t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u2019 know if I\u2019m the right person ter tell yeh\u2014but someone\u2019s gotta\u2014yeh can\u2019t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh\u2014mind, I can\u2019t tell yeh everythin\u2019, it\u2019s a great myst\u2019ry, parts of it\u2026\u201d\n\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \u201cIt begins, I suppose, with\u2014with a person called\u2014but it\u2019s incredible yeh don\u2019t know his name, everyone in our world knows\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I don\u2019 like sayin\u2019 the name if I can help it. No one does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cGulpin\u2019 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went\u2026 bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\n\n\u201cCould you write it down?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cNah can\u2019t spell it. All right\u2014Voldemort.\u201d Hagrid shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again. Anyway, this\u2014this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\u2019 fer followers. Got \u2019em, too\u2014some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\u2019 his power, \u2019cause he was gettin\u2019 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\u2019t know who ter trust, didn\u2019t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches\u2026 terrible things happened. He was takin\u2019 over. \u2019Course, some stood up to him\u2014an\u2019 he killed \u2019em. Horribly. One o\u2019 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u2019t dare try takin\u2019 the school, not jus\u2019 then, anyway.\n\n\u201cNow, yer mum an\u2019 dad were as good a witch an\u2019 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\u2019 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\u2019ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get \u2019em on his side before\u2026 probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\u2019 ter do with the Dark Side.\n\n\u201cMaybe he thought he could persuade \u2019em\u2026 maybe he just wanted \u2019em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\u2019\u2014an\u2019\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s that sad\u2014knew yer mum an\u2019 dad, an\u2019 nicer people yeh couldn\u2019t find\u2014anyway\u2026\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who killed \u2019em. An\u2019 then\u2014an\u2019 this is the real myst\u2019ry of the thing\u2014he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\u2019 by then. But he couldn\u2019t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u2019s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh\u2014took care of yer mum an\u2019 dad an\u2019 yer house, even\u2014but it didn\u2019t work on you, an\u2019 that\u2019s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u2018em, no one except you, an\u2019 he\u2019d killed some o\u2019 the best witches an\u2019 wizards of the age\u2014the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts\u2014an\u2019 you was only a baby, an\u2019 you lived.\u201d\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u2019s mind. As Hagrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before\u2014and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\n\n\u201cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\u2019s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLoad of old tosh,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\n\n\u201cNow, you listen here, boy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cI accept there\u2019s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\u2019t have cured\u2014and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\u2019s better off without them in my opinion\u2014asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types\u2014just what I expected, always knew they\u2019d come to a sticky end\u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dursley\u2014I\u2019m warning you\u2014one more word\u2026\u201d\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\n\n\u201cBut what happened to Vol\u2014, sorry\u2014I mean, You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u2019s the biggest myst\u2019ry, see\u2026 he was gettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful\u2014why\u2019d he go?\n\n\u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\u2019s still out there, bidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. Don\u2019 reckon they could\u2019ve done if he was comin\u2019 back.\n\n\u201cMost of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause somethin\u2019 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he hadn\u2019t counted on\u2014I dunno what it was, no one does\u2014but somethin\u2019 about you stumped him, all right.\u201d\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time they\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI think you must have made a mistake. I don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\n\u201cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it\u2026 every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry\u2026 chased by Dudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach\u2026 dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow back\u2026 and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him?\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry Potter, not a wizard\u2014you wait, you\u2019ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a fight.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u201d he hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to Stonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish\u2014spell books and wands and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop him,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cStop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s son goin\u2019 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u2019s been down ever since he was born. He\u2019s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\u2019t know himself. He\u2019ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \u201cNEVER,\u201d he thundered, \u201c\u2014INSULT\u2014ALBUS\u2014DUMBLEDORE\u2014IN\u2014FRONT\u2014OF\u2014ME!\u201d\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\u2014there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\u2019s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019ta lost me temper,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\u2019t much left ter do.\u201d\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n\u201cBe grateful if yeh didn\u2019t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014er\u2014not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\u2019. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\u2019 get yer letters to yeh an\u2019 stuff\u2014one o\u2019 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you supposed to do magic?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, well\u2014I was at Hogwarts meself but I\u2014er\u2014got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\u2019 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and we\u2019ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\u201d said Hagrid loudly. \u201cGotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\u2019 that.\u201d\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou can kip under that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\u2019 dormice in one o\u2019 the pockets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. DIAGON ALLEY\n\n\n\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he told himself firmly. \u201cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard.\u201d\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s an owl\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPay him,\u201d Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets\u2014bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags\u2026 finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.\n\n\u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n\u201cKnuts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n\u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\n\n\u201cUm\u2014Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any money\u2014and you heard Uncle Vernon last night\u2026 he won\u2019t pay for me to go and learn magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \u201cD\u2019yeh think yer parents didn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if their house was destroyed\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a sausage, they\u2019re not bad cold\u2014an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no teh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cWizards have banks?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n\u201cGoblins?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe\u2014\u2019cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\u2019 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\u201d Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \u201cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\u2019 you gettin\u2019 things from Gringotts\u2014knows he can trust me, see.\n\n\u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n\n\u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cFlew?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter use magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\n\u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter\u2014er\u2014speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\n\u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cSpells\u2014enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way\u2014Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die of hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\u201d\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life.\n\n\u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u201d\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \u201cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \u201cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so they say,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCrikey, I\u2019d like a dragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted one ever since I was a kid\u2014here we go.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t understand \u201cMuggle money,\u201d as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\n\n\u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s a list there of everything yeh need.\u201d\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t noticed the night before, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\nFirst year students will require:\n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\n\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\n\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\n\n4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)\n\nPlease note that all pupils\u2019 clothes should carry name tags\n\nCOURSE BOOKS\n\nAll students should have a copy of each of the following:\n\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\n\nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\n\nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\n\nA Beginners\u2019 Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch\n\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\n\nMagical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander\n\nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self Protection by Quentin Trimble\n\nOTHER EQUIPMENT\n\n1 wand\n\n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set\n\n1 set of glass or crystal phials\n\n1 telescope set\n\n1 brass scales\n\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\n\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS\n\n\n\n\u201cCan we buy all this in London?\u201d Harry wondered aloud.\n\n\u201cIf yeh know where to go,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual, Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees buckle.\n\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis this\u2014can this be ?\u201d\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n\u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry Potter\u2026 what an honor.\u201d\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n\u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand\u2014I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\u201d Harry shook hands again and again\u2014Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\n\u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\u201d He looked terrified at the very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\n\u201cMust get on\u2014lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n\u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh\u2014mind you, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience\u2026 They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag\u2014never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\n\u201cThree up\u2026 two across,\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight, stand back, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered\u2014it wriggled\u2014in the middle, a small hole appeared\u2014it grew wider and wider\u2014a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\nHe grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons\u2014All Sizes\u2014Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver\u2014Self Stirring\u2014Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we gotta get yer money first.\u201d\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u201cDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad\u2026\u201d\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium\u2014Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of them say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand\u2014fastest ever\u2014\u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon\u2026\n\n\u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was\u2014\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\n\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\n\n\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours,\n\nThief, you have been warned, beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike I said, Yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More \u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in\u2014Hagrid with some difficulty\u2014and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late\u2014they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d\n\n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry\u2019s\u2014it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n\n\u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said Griphook.\n\n\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least\u2014but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life\u2014more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n\n\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here\u2014another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n\u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n\n\u201cI do\u2014Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been\u2014imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n\n\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\n\n\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage\u2014lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the drawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know\u2014not knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s.\n\n\u201c\u2014and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were\u2014he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\u2019 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in \u2019em in a long line o\u2019 Muggles\u2014look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like\u2014like soccer in the Muggle world\u2014everyone follows Quidditch\u2014played up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls\u2014sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\n\u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d\n\n\u201cVol\u2014sorry\u2014You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\n\n\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of the curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d\n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again.\n\n\u201cJust yer wand left\u2014A yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birthday present.\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at\u2014an\u2019 I don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander\u2019s left now\u2014only place fer wands, Ollivander\u2019s, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d\n\nA magic wand\u2026 this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it\u2014it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands\u2026 well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do\u2026\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again\u2026 Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now\u2014Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014well, I\u2019m right handed,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n\n\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried\u2014but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n\n\u201cNo, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere\u2014I wonder, now\u2014yes, why not\u2014unusual combination\u2014holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well\u2026 how curious\u2026 how very curious\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious\u2026 curious\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather\u2014just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it\u2019s brother\u2014why, it\u2019s brother gave you that scar.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n\u201cYes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember\u2026 I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter\u2026 After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things\u2014terrible, yes, but great.\u201d\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birthday of his life\u2014and yet\u2014he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander\u2026 but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol\u2014sorry\u2014I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d\n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts\u2014I did\u2014still do, \u2019smatter of fact.\u201d\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\n\n\u201cYer ticket fer Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst o\u2019 September\u2014King\u2019s Cross\u2014it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll know where to find me\u2026 See yeh soon, Harry.\u201d\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him\u2014in fact, they didn\u2019t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Uncle Vernon?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to\u2014to go to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n\u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u201d\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\n\u201cFunny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cWhere is this school, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\u2019clock,\u201d he read.\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\n\u201cPlatform what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on my ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201chowling mad, the lot of them. You\u2019ll see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take you to King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\n\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle Vernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\u201d\n\nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes\u2014he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine\u2014platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do they?\u201d\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\n\n\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2014packed with Muggles, of course\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\u2019s in front of him\u2014and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s the platform number?\u201d said the boys\u2019 mother.\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters!\u201d piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, \u201cMom, can\u2019t I go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\u201d\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it\u2014but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n\u201cFred, you next,\u201d the plump woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u201d said the boy. \u201cHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m George?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, George, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, I am Fred,\u201d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone\u2014but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there\u2014and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\u2019t anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s new, too.\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe thing is\u2014the thing is, I don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to get onto the platform?\u201d she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\u2019d be in trouble\u2014leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run\u2014the barrier was coming nearer and nearer\u2014he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop\u2014the cart was out of control\u2014he was a foot away\u2014he closed his eyes ready for the crash\u2014\n\nIt didn\u2019t come\u2026 he kept on running\u2026 he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o\u2019clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-quarters on it. He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying, \u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Neville,\u201d he heard the old woman sigh.\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\n\u201cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\u201d\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\n\u201cWant a hand?\u201d It was one of the red haired twins he\u2019d followed through the barrier.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry panted.\n\n\u201cOy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u201d\n\nWith the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\u2019s lightning scar.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said the first twin. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he added to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d chorused the twins.\n\n\u201cOh, him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, yes, I am.\u201d\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\u2019s open door.\n\n\u201cFred? George? Are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing, Mom.\u201d\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n\u201cRon, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u201d\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n\u201cMom\u2014geroff\u2014\u201d He wriggled free.\n\n\u201cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Percy?\u201d said their mother.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\u201d said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \u201cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cOnce\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr twice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA minute\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll summer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Percy the Prefect.\n\n\u201cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a prefect,\u201d said their mother fondly. \u201cAll right, dear, well, have a good term\u2014send me an owl when you get there.\u201d\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n\n\u201cNow, you two\u2014this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve blown up a toilet or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. And look after Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n\n\u201cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\u201d\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him looking.\n\n\u201cYou know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the little girl\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\u2019t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\u2019s really there\u2014like lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor dear\u2014no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\u201d\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n\u201cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, keep your hair on.\u201d\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, Mom.\u201d\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\n\n\u201cAnyone sitting there?\u201d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \u201cEverywhere else is full.\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\n\n\u201cHey, Ron.\u201d\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re going down the middle of the train\u2014Lee Jordan\u2019s got a giant tarantula down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d mumbled Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said the other twin, \u201cdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\n\n\u201cAre you really Harry Potter?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\u2019s jokes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd have you really got\u2014you know\u2026\u201d\n\nHe pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where You-Know-Who\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\n\u201cAre all your family wizards?\u201d asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Yes, I think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think Mom\u2019s got a second cousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you must know loads of magic already.\u201d\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\n\u201cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat are they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible\u2014well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\u2019d had three wizard brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \u201cI\u2019m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\u2019ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left\u2014Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\u2019re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand, and Percy\u2019s old rat.\u201d\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Scabbers and he\u2019s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\u2019t aff\u2014I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\u2019s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\n\u201c\u2026and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\u2014\u201d\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou said You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u201d said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you, of all people\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI just never knew you shouldn\u2019t. See what I mean? I\u2019ve got loads to learn\u2026 I bet,\u201d he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \u201cI bet I\u2019m the worst in the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be. There\u2019s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\u201d\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \u201cAnything off the cart, dears?\u201d\n\nHarry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\u2019s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\u2019d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry\u2014but the woman didn\u2019t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\n\n\u201cHungry, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStarving,\u201d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \u201cShe always forgets I don\u2019t like corned beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwap you for one of these,\u201d said Harry, holding up a pasty. \u201cGo on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, it\u2019s all dry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t got much time,\u201d he added quickly, \u201cyou know, with five of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, have a pasty,\u201d said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\u2019s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \u201cThey\u2019re not really frogs, are they?\u201d He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut see what the card is. I\u2019m missing Agrippa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course, you wouldn\u2019t know\u2014Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect\u2014famous witches and wizards. I\u2019ve got about five hundred, but I haven\u2019t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\u201d\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\u2019s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSo this is Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d never heard of Dumbledore!\u201d said Ron. \u201cCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa\u2014thanks\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\n\n\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\u2019s face had disappeared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again and I\u2019ve got about six of her\u2026 do you want it? You can start collecting.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u201d Ron sounded amazed. \u201cWeird!\u201d\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\u201cYou want to be careful with those,\u201d Ron warned Harry. \u201cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor\u2014you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\u201d\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n\n\u201cBleaaargh\u2014see? Sprouts.\u201d\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you seen a toad at all?\u201d\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \u201cI\u2019ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll turn up,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy miserably. \u201cWell, if you see him\u2026\u201d\n\nHe left.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf I\u2019d brought a toad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cHe might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference,\u201d said Ron in disgust. \u201cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, look\u2026\u201d\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n\n\u201cUnicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway\u2014\u201d\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\u2019s lost one,\u201d she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already told him we haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Ron, but the girl wasn\u2019t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\n\u201cOh, are you doing magic? Let\u2019s see it, then.\u201d\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014all right.\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\u2019s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\u2019s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\u2019ve heard\u2014I\u2019ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough\u2014I\u2019m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\u201d\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\u2019t learned all the course books by heart either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ron Weasley,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAre you really?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI know all about you, of course\u2014I got a few extra books for background reading, and you\u2019re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n\u201cGoodness, didn\u2019t you know, I\u2019d have found out everything I could if it was me,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDo either of you know what house you\u2019ll be in? I\u2019ve been asking around, and I hope I\u2019m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u2026 Anyway, we\u2019d better go and look for Neville\u2019s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n\u201cWhatever house I\u2019m in, I hope she\u2019s not in it,\u201d said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \u201cStupid spell\u2014George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat house are your brothers in?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cGryffindor,\u201d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \u201cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll say if I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the house Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\u2019 whiskers are a bit lighter,\u201d said Harry, trying to take Ron\u2019s mind off houses. \u201cSo what do your oldest brothers do now that they\u2019ve left, anyway?\u201d\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\u2019d finished school.\n\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\u2019s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDid you hear about Gringotts? It\u2019s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\u2019t suppose you get that with the Muggles\u2014someone tried to rob a high security vault.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cReally? What happened to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such big news. They haven\u2019t been caught. My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\u2019t think they took anything, that\u2019s what\u2019s odd. \u2019Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u201d\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \u201cVoldemort\u201d without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite Quidditch team?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I don\u2019t know any,\u201d Harry confessed.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Ron looked dumbfounded. \u201cOh, you wait, it\u2019s the best game in the world\u2014\u201d And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\u2019d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\u2019d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\u2019t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\u2019d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\u2019s in this compartment. So it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\n\n\u201cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u201d said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \u201cAnd my name\u2019s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n\n\u201cThink my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\u201d\n\nHe turned back to Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry didn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\u201d he said coolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn\u2019t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\u2019t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\u2019ll rub off on you.\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to fight us, are you?\u201d Malfoy sneered.\n\n\u201cUnless you get out now,\u201d said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\u2019ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\u201d\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron\u2014Ron leapt forward, but before he\u2019d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\u2019s knuckle\u2014Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\u2019d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n\n\u201cWhat has been going on?\u201d she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u201d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t believe it\u2014he\u2019s gone back to sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met Malfoy before?\u201d\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of his family,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\u2019d been bewitched. My dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He says Malfoy\u2019s father didn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\u201d He turned to Hermione. \u201cCan we help you with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\u2019re nearly there. You haven\u2019t been fighting, have you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we even get there!\u201d\n\n\u201cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\u201d said Ron, scowling at her. \u201cWould you mind leaving while we change?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\u201d said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\u201d\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: \u201cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \u201cFirs\u2019 years! Firs\u2019 years over here! All right there, Harry?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, follow me\u2014any more firs\u2019 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\u2019 years follow me!\u201d\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019 all get yer firs\u2019 sight o\u2019 Hogwarts in a sec,\u201d Hagrid called over his shoulder, \u201cjus\u2019 round this bend here.\u201d\n\nThere was a loud \u201cOooooh!\u201d\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n\u201cNo more\u2019n four to a boat!\u201d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.\n\n\u201cEveryone in?\u201d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \u201cRight then\u2014FORWARD!\u201d\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n\u201cHeads down!\u201d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n\n\u201cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\u201d said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\n\n\u201cTrevor!\u201d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.\n\n\u201cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\u201d\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. THE SORTING HAT\n\n\n\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\u2019s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\n\n\u201cThe firs\u2019 years, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\u2019 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here\u2014but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Hogwarts,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThe start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n\n\u201cThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\n\u201cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\u201d\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\u2019s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\u2019s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n\n\u201cI shall return when we are ready for you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cPlease wait quietly.\u201d\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\u201cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\u201d he asked Ron.\n\n\u201cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet\u2014what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\u2019t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\u2019d learned and wondering which one she\u2019d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\u2019d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his teacher\u2019s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air\u2014several people behind him screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\u2019s not really even a ghost\u2014I say, what are you all doing here?\u201d\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\u201cNew students!\u201d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \u201cAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?\u201d\n\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\n\u201cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\u201d said the Friar. \u201cMy old house, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove along now,\u201d said a sharp voice. \u201cThe Sorting Ceremony\u2019s about to start.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \u201cand follow me.\u201d\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the heavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in the house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing\u2014noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth\u2014and the hat began to sing:\n\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty,\n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see,\n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\n\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\n\nSet Gryffindors apart;\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\n\nAnd unafraid of toil;\n\n\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nIf you\u2019ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\n\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYou\u2019ll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\n\n\nSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid!\n\nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap!\n\nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u201d Ron whispered to Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott, Hannah!\u201d\n\nA pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause\u2014\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat.\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\n\n\u201cBones, Susan!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n\n\u201cBoot, Terry!\u201d\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n\n\u201cBrocklehurst, Mandy\u201d went to Ravenclaw too, but \u201cBrown, Lavender\u201d became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\u2019s twin brothers catcalling.\n\n\u201cBulstrode, Millicent\u201d then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\u2019s imagination, after all he\u2019d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n\n\u201cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \u201cFinnigan, Seamus,\u201d the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cGranger, Hermione!\u201d\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n\n\u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\u2019re very nervous. What if he wasn\u2019t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\u2019d better get back on the train?\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR,\u201d Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \u201cMacDougal, Morag.\u201d\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many people left now. \u201cMoon\u201d\u2026, \u201cNott\u201d\u2026, \u201cParkinson\u201d\u2026, then a pair of twin girls, \u201cPatil\u201d and \u201cPatil\u201d\u2026, then \u201cPerks, Sally Anne\u201d\u2026, and then, at last\u2014\n\n\u201cPotter, Harry!\u201d\n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n\n\u201cPotter, did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said a small voice in his ear. \u201cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\u2019s talent, ah my goodness, yes\u2014and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s interesting\u2026 So where shall I put you?\u201d\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n\n\u201cNot Slytherin, eh?\u201d said the small voice. \u201cAre you sure? You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that\u2014no? Well, if you\u2019re sure\u2014better be GRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \u201cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\u201d Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water.\n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ron, excellent,\u201d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \u201cZabini, Blaise,\u201d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not.\n\n\u201cIs he\u2014a bit mad?\u201d he asked Percy uncertainly.\n\n\u201cMad?\u201d said Percy airily. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n\n\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \u201cCan\u2019t you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who you are!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cMy brothers told me about you\u2014you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy\u2014\u201d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\n\n\u201cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u201d\n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t going at all the way he wanted.\n\n\u201cLike this,\u201d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \u201cSo\u2014new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s becoming almost unbearable\u2014he\u2019s the Slytherin ghost.\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cHow did he get covered in blood?\u201d asked Seamus with great interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding\u2014\u201d\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m half-and-half,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cMe dad\u2019s a Muggle. Mom didn\u2019t tell him she was a witch \u2019til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\u201d\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Neville?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u201d said Neville, \u201cbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me\u2014he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned\u2014but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced\u2014all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here\u2014they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\u201d\n\nOn Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\u201cI do hope they start right away, there\u2019s so much to learn, I\u2019m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\u2019s supposed to be very difficult\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing\u2014\u201d).\n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s eyes\u2014and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Percy.\n\n\u201cN-nothing.\u201d\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\u2019s look\u2014a feeling that he didn\u2019t like Harry at all.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u201d he asked Percy.\n\n\u201cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\u2019s looking so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\u2019t want to\u2014everyone knows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\u201d\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\u2019t look at him again.\n\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\n\u201cAhem\u2014just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notices to give you.\n\n\u201cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\n\u201cI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\n\u201cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\u201d\n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not serious?\u201d he muttered to Percy.\n\n\u201cMust be,\u201d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re not allowed to go somewhere\u2014the forest\u2019s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\u201d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\u2019 smiles had become rather fixed.\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\n\u201cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand off we go!\u201d\n\nAnd the school bellowed:\n\nHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\n\nTeach us something please,\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees,\n\n\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff,\n\nFor now they\u2019re bare and full of air,\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\n\n\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\n\nBring back what we\u2019ve forgot,\n\nJust do your best, we\u2019ll do the rest,\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\n\u201cAh, music,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\u2019s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d Percy whispered to the first years. \u201cA poltergeist.\u201d He raised his voice, \u201cPeeves\u2014show yourself!\u201d\n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\u201d\n\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n\n\u201cOooooooh!\u201d he said, with an evil cackle. \u201cIckle Firsties! What fun!\u201d\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\n\u201cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I mean it!\u201d barked Percy.\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\n\u201cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\u201d said Percy, as they set off again. \u201cThe Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one who can control him, he won\u2019t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\u201d\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCaput Draconis,\u201d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it\u2014Neville needed a leg up\u2014and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase\u2014they were obviously in one of the towers\u2014they found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\n\u201cGreat food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \u201cGet off, Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my sheets.\u201d\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\u2019s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully\u2014and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it\u2014then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold\u2014there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. THE POTIONS MASTER\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere, look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWearing the glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his scar?\u201d\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\n\nThere were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u2019t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\n\nThe ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \u201cGOT YOUR CONK!\u201d\n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\u2019s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u2019d whisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u2019s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\u201cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\u2019t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\u2019t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u2019t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have much of a head start.\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got today?\u201d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\n\n\u201cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape\u2019s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them\u2014we\u2019ll be able to see if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish McGonagall favored us,\u201d said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\u2019t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\n\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. Snape didn\u2019t dislike Harry\u2014he hated him.\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAh, Yes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new\u2014celebrity.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had none of Hagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\u2014like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\u2026 I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death\u2014if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d\n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\u2019t a dunderhead.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot into the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSnape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\u201cTut, tut\u2014fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\nHe ignored Hermione\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201d\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\u201d Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\u201d\n\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione does, though, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d\n\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \u201cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \u201cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\u201d\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\n\n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014Potter\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\u201d\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u2019d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week\u2014why did Snape hate him so much?\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Ron, \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\u201d\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u2019s voice rang out, saying, \u201cBack, Fang\u2014back.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d he said. \u201cBack, Fang.\u201d\n\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\n\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\n\u201cMake yerselves at home,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\n\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s freckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\u201d\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u2019s knee and drooled all over his robes.\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \u201cthat old git.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get rid of her\u2014Fitch puts her up to it.\u201d\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\n\u201cBut he seemed to really hate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhy should he?\u201d\n\nYet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u201d Hagrid asked Ron. \u201cI liked him a lot\u2014great with animals.\u201d\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\n\n\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t mentioned the date.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It might\u2019ve been happening while we were there!\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t meet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u2019d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u2019t want to tell Harry?\n\n\n\n\n\n9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\n\n\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u2019t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday\u2014and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\u201d\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cAnyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u2019s all talk.\u201d\n\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of a book\u2014not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\u2019s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Remembrall!\u201d he explained. \u201cGran knows I forget things\u2014this tells you if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red\u2014oh\u2026\u201d His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u201c\u2026you\u2019ve forgotten something\u2026\u201d\n\nNeville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got my Remembrall, Professor.\u201d\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\n\u201cJust looking,\u201d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\n\nAt three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked. \u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\n\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom,\u201d called Madam Hooch at the front, \u201cand say \u2018Up!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUP!\u201d everyone shouted.\n\nHarry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u2019d been doing it wrong for years.\n\n\u201cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle\u2014three\u2014two\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\u2019s lips.\n\n\u201cCome back, boy!\u201d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle\u2014twelve feet\u2014twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and\u2014\n\nWHAM\u2014a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n\n\u201cBroken wrist,\u201d Harry heard her mutter. \u201cCome on, boy\u2014it\u2019s all right, up you get.\u201d\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\n\u201cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\u2019ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \u2018Quidditch.\u2019 Come on, dear.\u201d\n\nNeville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n\n\u201cDid you see his face, the great lump?\u201d\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d snapped Parvati Patil.\n\n\u201cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\u201d said Pansy Parkinson, a hard faced Slytherin girl. \u201cNever thought you\u2019d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid thing Longbottom\u2019s gran sent him.\u201d\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\n\u201cGive that here, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find\u2014how about\u2014up a tree?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it here!\u201d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\u2019t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \u201cCome and get it, Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Hermione Granger. \u201cMadam Hooch told us not to move\u2014you\u2019ll get us all into trouble.\u201d\n\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\u2019d found something he could do without being taught\u2014this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d Harry called, \u201cor I\u2019ll knock you off that broom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\n\u201cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\u201d Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\u201cCatch it if you can, then!\u201d he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\u2014next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\u2014wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching\u2014he stretched out his hand\u2014a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\n\u201cHARRY POTTER!\u201d\n\nHis heart sank faster than he\u2019d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\n\u201cNever\u2014in all my time at Hogwarts\u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \u201c\u2014how dare you\u2014might have broken your neck\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault, Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Miss Patil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Malfoy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\u201d\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u2019s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\u2019s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted two weeks. He\u2019d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\u201d\n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who came out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking confused.\n\n\u201cFollow me, you two,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n\n\u201cIn here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n\n\u201cOut, Peeves!\u201d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n\n\u201cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood\u2014I\u2019ve found you a Seeker.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n\n\u201cAre you serious, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cThe boy\u2019s a natural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\n\n\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,\u201d Professor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n\n\u201cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\u201d he asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cWood\u2019s captain of the Gryffindor team,\u201d Professor McGonagall explained.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the build for a Seeker, too,\u201d said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \u201cLight\u2014speedy\u2014we\u2019ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor\u2014a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u2019t bend the first year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks\u2026\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n\n\u201cI want to hear you\u2019re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\u201d\n\nThen she suddenly smiled.\n\n\u201cYour father would have been proud,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all about it.\n\n\u201cSeeker?\u201d he said. \u201cBut first years never\u2014you must be the youngest house player in about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014a century,\u201d said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \u201cWood told me.\u201d\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n\n\u201cI start training next week,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnly don\u2019t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said George in a low voice. \u201cWood told us. We\u2019re on the team too\u2014Beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, we\u2019re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won since Charlie left, but this year\u2019s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u2019s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet it\u2019s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\u201d\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot braver now that you\u2019re back on the ground and you\u2019ve got your little friends with you,\u201d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take you on anytime on my own,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cTonight, if you want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only\u2014no contact. What\u2019s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Ron, wheeling around. \u201cI\u2019m his second, who\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n\n\u201cCrabbe,\u201d he said. \u201cMidnight all right? We\u2019ll meet you in the trophy room; that\u2019s always unlocked.\u201d\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \u201cWhat is a wizard\u2019s duel?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd what do you mean, you\u2019re my second?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u201d said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u2019s face, he added quickly, \u201cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\u201d Ron suggested.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t a person eat in peace in this place?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you could,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201c\u2014and you mustn\u2019t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if you\u2019re caught, and you\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very selfish of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Ron.\n\nAll the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u2019t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \u201cIf he tries to curse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t remember how to block them.\u201d There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness\u2014this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face to face. He couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\n\u201cHalf past eleven,\u201d Ron muttered at last, \u201cwe\u2019d better go.\u201d\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to do this, Harry.\u201d\n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cGo back to bed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost told your brother,\u201d Hermione snapped, \u201cPercy\u2014he\u2019s a prefect, he\u2019d put a stop to this.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n\nHermione wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\u2019t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\u2019ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\u2019re on the train home tomorrow, you\u2019re so\u2014\u201d\n\nBut what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\n\n\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d she asked shrilly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\nThey hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\u2019ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve\u2014\u201d said Ron loudly.\n\n\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cI heard something.\u201d\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n\n\u201cMrs. Norris?\u201d breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n\n\u201cThank goodness you found me! I\u2019ve been out here for hours, I couldn\u2019t remember the new password to get in to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\u2019s \u2018Pig snout\u2019 but it won\u2019t help you now, the Fat Lady\u2019s gone off somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Neville, showing them. \u201cMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u2014well, look, Neville, we\u2019ve got to be somewhere, we\u2019ll see you later\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u2019s been past twice already.\u201d\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\n\n\u201cIf either of you get us caught, I\u2019ll never rest until I\u2019ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\u201d\n\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn\u2019t Malfoy.\n\n\u201cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\u201d\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\u2019s voice. Neville\u2019s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in here somewhere,\u201d they heard him mutter, \u201cprobably hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following\u2014they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going\u2014they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n\n\u201cI\u2014told\u2014you,\u201d Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \u201cI\u2014told\u2014you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\u201d said Ron, \u201cquickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy tricked you,\u201d Hermione said to Harry. \u201cYou realize that, don\u2019t you? He was never going to meet you\u2014Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\u201d\n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. They hadn\u2019t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n\n\u201cShut up, Peeves\u2014please\u2014you\u2019ll get us thrown out.\u201d\n\nPeeves cackled.\n\n\u201cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\u2019ll get caughty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t give us away, Peeves, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould tell Filch, I should,\u201d said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\n\n\u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\u201d Peeves bellowed, \u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\u2014\u201d\n\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door\u2014and it was locked.\n\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \u201cWe\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u201d They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\u2019s shouts.\n\n\u201cOh, move over,\u201d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u2019s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \u201cAlohomora!\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open\u2014they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\n\u201cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\u201d Filch was saying. \u201cQuick, tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cShan\u2019t say nothing if you don\u2019t say please,\u201d said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing if you didn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u201d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\n\u201cHe thinks this door is locked,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay\u2014get off, Neville!\u201d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u2019s bathrobe for the last minute. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry turned around\u2014and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\u2019d walked into a nightmare\u2014this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\n\nThey weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob\u2014between Filch and death, he\u2019d take Filch.\n\nThey fell backward\u2014Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\u2019t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared\u2014all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\n\u201cWhere on earth have you all been?\u201d she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\n\u201cNever mind that\u2014pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\u2019d never speak again.\n\n\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\u201d\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \u201cYou don\u2019t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\u201d she snapped. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what it was standing on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe floor?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s obviously guarding something.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\u2014or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think we dragged her along, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something\u2026 What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide\u2014except perhaps Hogwarts.\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. HALLOWEEN\n\n\n\n\nMalfoy couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOr both,\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\u2019t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a broomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\u2019clock for your first training session.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\u201d Ron moaned enviously. \u201cI\u2019ve never even touched one.\u201d\n\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t resist it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry. \u201cComets look flashy, but they\u2019re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u2019t afford half the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back. \u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked.\n\n\u201cPotter\u2019s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said Malfoy quickly.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u201d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u201d he added.\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t stolen Neville\u2019s Remembrall I wouln\u2019t be on the team\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking rules?\u201d came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t stop now,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019s doing us so much good.\u201d\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\u2019s bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n\nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\u2019d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling\u2014he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\n\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what McGonagall meant\u2026 you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team practice three times a week.\u201d\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo\u2014that\u2019s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called the Keeper. I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air\u2014it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \u201cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u2019s why you have two Beaters on each team\u2014the Weasley twins are ours\u2014it\u2019s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So\u2014think you\u2019ve got all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\u201d Harry reeled off.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u201d Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\n\n\u201cNever at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014unless they crack my head open.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers\u2014I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\u201d\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the most important ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch because it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\u2014I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it\u2014any questions?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t practice with the Snitch yet,\u201d said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \u201cit\u2019s too dark, we might lose it. Let\u2019s try you out with a few of these.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u2019t carry on.\n\n\u201cThat Quidditch cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u201d said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing dragons.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\u2019d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\u2019s broomstick had arrived.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve been practicing!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too\u2014never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f\u2019 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\u201d\n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it\u2014Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n\nRon, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more luck.\n\n\u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it wrong,\u201d Harry heard Hermione snap. \u201cIt\u2019s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \u2018gar\u2019 nice and long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u201d Ron snarled.\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\n\n\u201cOh, well done!\u201d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \u201cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u201d\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u201d he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \u201cshe\u2019s a nightmare, honestly.\u201d\n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face\u2014and was startled to see that she was in tears.\n\n\u201cI think she heard you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \u201cShe must\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u201d\n\nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u2019 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u2019s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \u201cTroll\u2014in the dungeons\u2014thought you ought to know.\u201d\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence.\n\n\u201cPrefects,\u201d he rumbled, \u201clead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\u201d\n\nPercy was in his element.\n\n\u201cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could a troll get in?\u201d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\u201d\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought\u2014Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u201d\n\nRon bit his lip.\n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut Percy\u2019d better not see us.\u201d\n\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\u2019 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch me.\u201d\n\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\u2019s fading footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u201d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n\n\u201cCan you smell something?\u201d\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n\nAnd then they heard it\u2014a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed\u2014at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n\n\u201cThe keys in the lock,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could lock it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop\u2014a high, petrified scream\u2014and it was coming from the chamber they\u2019d just chained up.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d they said together.\n\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\n\n\u201cConfuse it!\u201d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n\n\u201cOy, pea brain!\u201d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u2019t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n\n\u201cCome on, run, run!\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\u2019s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his hand when he\u2019d jumped\u2014it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s nostrils.\n\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\u2014not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over\u2014and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\n\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\n\n\u201cIs it\u2014dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think it\u2019s just been knocked out.\u201d\n\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n\n\u201cUrgh\u2014troll boogers.\u201d\n\nHe wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers.\n\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\u2019t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u201d\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cPlease, Professor McGonagall\u2014they were looking for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n\n\u201cI went looking for the troll because I\u2014I thought I could deal with it on my own\u2014you know, because I\u2019ve read all about them.\u201d\n\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u2019t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u2019t new to them.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014in that case\u2026\u201d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \u201cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\u201d\n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you. If you\u2019re not hurt at all, you\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\u201d\n\nHermione left.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\u201d\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\n\n\u201cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\u201d Ron grumbled.\n\n\u201cFive, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u201d Ron admitted. \u201cMind you, we did save her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t locked the thing in with her,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n\n\u201cPig snout,\u201d they said and entered.\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d and hurried off to get plates.\n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n11. QUIDDITCH\n\n\n\n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\u2019t know which was worse\u2014people telling him he\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\n\n\u201cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,\u201d said Snape. \u201cGive it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just made that rule up,\u201d Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \u201cWonder what\u2019s wrong with his leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u201d said Ron bitterly.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\u2019s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\u201cHow will you learn?\u201d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.\n\n\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside\u2014and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\n\n\u201cBlasted thing,\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but\u2014\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\n\n\u201cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGET OUT! OUT!\u201d\n\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\n\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Ron asked as Harry joined them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\u2019d seen.\n\n\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d he finished breathlessly. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was going when we saw him\u2014he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! And I\u2019d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were wide.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not very nice, but he wouldn\u2019t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cI\u2019m with Harry. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past Snape. But what\u2019s he after? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u201d\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He tried to empty his mind\u2014he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours\u2014but the expression on Snape\u2019s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\u2019t easy to forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat some breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a bit of toast,\u201d wheedled Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\u2019s time he\u2019d be walking onto the field.\n\n\u201cHarry, you need your strength,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan. \u201cSeekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Seamus,\u201d said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.\n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\u201cOkay, men,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d Wood agreed. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big one,\u201d said Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cThe one we\u2019ve all been waiting for,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWe know Oliver\u2019s speech by heart,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cwe were on the team last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you two,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis is the best team Gryffindor\u2019s had in years. We\u2019re going to win. I know it.\u201d\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \u201cOr else.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. It\u2019s time. Good luck, all of you.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\u2019t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\n\n\u201cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\u201d she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\n\n\u201cMount your brooms, please.\u201d\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\n\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\n\n\u201cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor\u2014what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Professor.\u201d\n\nThe Weasley twins\u2019 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\u2019s, last year only a reserve\u2014back to Johnson and\u2014no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes\u2014Flint flying like an eagle up there\u2014he\u2019s going to sc\u2014no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle\u2014that\u2019s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and\u2014OUCH\u2014that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger\u2014Quaffle taken by the Slytherins\u2014that\u2019s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\u2019s blocked by a second Bludger\u2014sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\u2019t tell which\u2014nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes\u2014she\u2019s really flying\u2014dodges a speeding Bludger\u2014the goal posts are ahead\u2014come on, now, Angelina\u2014Keeper Bletchley dives\u2014misses\u2014GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\n\n\u201cBudge up there, move along.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\n\n\u201cBin watchin\u2019 from me hut,\u201d said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the same as bein\u2019 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had much to do yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKept outta trouble, though, that\u2019s somethin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\n\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\u2019s game plan.\n\n\u201cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\u201d Wood had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you attacked before you have to be.\u201d\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\u2019 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession,\u201d Lee Jordan was saying, \u201cChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the\u2014wait a moment\u2014was that the Snitch?\u201d\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs\u2014he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead\u2014he put on an extra spurt of speed\u2014\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below\u2014Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\u2019s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \u201cSend him off, ref! Red card!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cRed card!\u201d said Dean furiously. \u201cIn soccer you get shown the red card and you\u2019re out of the game!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t soccer, Dean,\u201d Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\u201d\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan!\u201d growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cI mean, after that open and revolting foul\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan, I\u2019m warning you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u201d\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts\u2014he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out\u2014and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession\u2014Flint with the Quaffle\u2014passes Spinnet\u2014passes Bell\u2014hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\u2014only joking, Professor\u2014Slytherins score\u2014A no\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\u201cDunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \u201cIf I didn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d lost control of his broom\u2026 but he can\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\u2019s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\n\n\u201cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\u201d Seamus whispered.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have,\u201d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \u201cCan\u2019t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic\u2014no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\u201d\n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\u2019s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d moaned Ron, gray faced.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Hermione gasped, \u201cSnape\u2014look.\u201d\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing something\u2014jinxing the broom,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good\u2014every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately.\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\u2019s robes.\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row\u2014Snape would never know what had happened.\n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\n\n\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes.\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick\u2014he hit the field on all fours\u2014coughed\u2014and something gold fell into his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u201d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\u201d Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference\u2014Harry hadn\u2019t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results\u2014Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt was Snape,\u201d Ron was explaining, \u201cHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \u201cWhy would Snape do somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\n\n\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d he told Hagrid. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\n\n\u201cHow do you know about Fluffy?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFluffy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014he\u2019s mine\u2014bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\u2019 year\u2014I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t ask me anymore,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cThat\u2019s top secret, that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Snape\u2019s trying to steal it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cSnape\u2019s a Hogwarts teacher, he\u2019d do nothin\u2019 of the sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why did he just try to kill Harry?\u201d cried Hermione.\n\nThe afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.\n\n\u201cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\u2019ve read all about them! You\u2019ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\u2019t blinking at all, I saw him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u201d said Hagrid hotly. \u201cI don\u2019 know why Harry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh\u2014yer meddlin\u2019 in things that don\u2019 concern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019 you forget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor Dumbledore an\u2019 Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED\n\n\n\n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\n\n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted at home.\u201d\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\u2019d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s cold drawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose\u2014that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u201d\n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d\n\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\u201d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \u201cMalfoy was insultin\u2019 his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\u2019t more. Move along, all of you.\u201d\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s back, \u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll get him\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them both,\u201d said Harry, \u201cMalfoy and Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cTell yeh what, come with me an\u2019 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\u201d\n\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\n\n\u201cAh, Hagrid, the last tree\u2014put it in the far corner, would you?\u201d\n\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\n\n\u201cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\u201d Hagrid asked.\n\n\u201cJust one,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd that reminds me\u2014Harry, Ron, we\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\n\n\u201cThe library?\u201d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \u201cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re not working,\u201d Harry told him brightly. \u201cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been trying to find out who he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Hagrid looked shocked. \u201cListen here\u2014I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that dog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u201d Harry added. \u201cWe must\u2019ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\u2019t find him anywhere\u2014just give us a hint\u2014I know I\u2019ve read his name somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid flatly.\n\n\u201cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\u201d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on\u2014out!\u201d\n\nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\n\n\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork\u2014bread, English muffins, marshmallows\u2014and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family\u2014in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \u201cDon\u2019t send me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWill you look at this? I\u2019ve got some presents!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect, turnips?\u201d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s.\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it\u2014it sounded a bit like an owl.\n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.\n\n\n\nTaped to the note was a fifty pence piece.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s friendly,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n\n\u201cWeird!\u201d he said, \u201cWhat a shape! This is money?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \u201cHagrid and my aunt and uncle\u2014so who sent these?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u201d said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \u201cMy mom. I told her you didn\u2019t expect any presents and\u2014oh, no,\u201d he groaned, \u201cshe\u2019s made you a Weasley sweater.\u201d\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n\n\u201cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\u201d said Ron, unwrapping his own, \u201cand mine\u2019s always maroon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of her,\u201d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.\n\nHis next present also contained candy\u2014a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\n\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\u2019d gotten from Hermione. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is\u2014they\u2019re really rare, and really valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is\u2014try it on.\u201d\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n\n\u201cIt is! Look down!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a note!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cA note fell out of it!\u201d\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n\nYour father left this in my possession before he died.\n\nIt is time it was returned to you.\n\nUse it well.\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\n\n\n\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give anything for one of these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, look\u2014Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred, holding up Harry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re not family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George demanded. \u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u201d George observed. \u201cI suppose she thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid\u2014we know we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise.\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n\n\u201cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t\u2014want,\u201d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\u201d said George. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d\n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce\u2014and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\u2019s Christmas dinner.\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much.\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge.\n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.\n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n\nHis father\u2019s\u2026 this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\n\nUse it well.\n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.\n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\u2014his father\u2019s cloak\u2014he felt that this time\u2014the first time\u2014he wanted to use it alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.\n\nThe library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence\u2014the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside\u2014stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\u2019t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\n\n\u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library Restricted Section.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \u201cThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him\u2014the cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid.\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket\u2014but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed\u2014for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder\u2014but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\u2019s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air\u2014she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes\u2014her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green\u2014exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\u2019s did.\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees\u2014Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face, whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried from the room.\n\n\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly.\n\n\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\u2019t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou look odd.\u201d\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m freezing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s forget it and go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Harry hissed. I know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here\u2014just here\u2014yes!\u201d\n\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\n\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! Look at them all\u2026 there are loads of them\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u201d\n\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\u2019t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\n\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCan you see all your family standing around you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m alone\u2014but I\u2019m different\u2014I look older\u2014and I\u2019m head boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am\u2014I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to\u2014and I\u2019m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup\u2014I\u2019m Quidditch captain, too.\u201d\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can it? All my family are dead\u2014let me have another look\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\u2019s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me\u2014\u201d\n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\u2019t realized how loudly they had been talking.\n\n\u201cQuick!\u201d\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing\u2014did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe\u2014she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\u201d\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\n\nThe snow still hadn\u2019t melted the next morning.\n\n\u201cWant to play chess, Harry?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go down and visit Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 you go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\u2019t go back tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it\u2014and anyway, you\u2019ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\u2019t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Harry, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\u2019t going to stop him.\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\u2019t meet anyone.\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\n\nExcept\u2014\n\n\u201cSo\u2014back again, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him.\n\n\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \u201cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I expect you\u2019ve realized by now what it does?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2014well\u2014it shows me my family\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\u201d\n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \u201cIt shows us what we want\u2026 whatever we want\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\n\n\u201cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\u201d\n\nHarry stood up.\n\n\u201cSir\u2014Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cOne can never have enough socks,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnother Christmas has come and gone and I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\u201d\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n\n\n\n\n\n13. NICOLAS FLAMEL\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\u2019d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\u201d said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\u201cIf Filch had caught you!\u201d), and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\u2019d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\n\n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an excuse to pick on us.\u201d\n\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\u2026\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me for a moment,\u201d said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \u201cI need to concen\u2014\u201d He caught sight of Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You look terrible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\u2019s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play,\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re ill,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cPretend to break your leg,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cReally break your leg,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u2019s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\u2019s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d said Neville shakily. \u201cI met him outside the library. He said he\u2019d been looking for someone to practice that on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Professor McGonagall!\u201d Hermione urged Neville. \u201cReport him!\u201d\n\nNeville shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want more trouble,\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s used to walking all over people, but that\u2019s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to tell me I\u2019m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s already done that,\u201d Neville choked out.\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worth twelve of Malfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\u2019t it? And where\u2019s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n\n\u201cThanks, Harry\u2026 I think I\u2019ll go to bed\u2026 D\u2019you want the card, you collect them, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n\n\u201cDumbledore again,\u201d he said, \u201cHe was the first one I ever\u2014\u201d\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found him!\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve found Flamel! I told you I\u2019d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here\u2014listen to this: \u2018Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u2019!\u201d\n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u2019t looked so excited since they\u2019d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n\n\u201cStay there!\u201d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\u2019 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\n\u201cI never thought to look in here!\u201d she whispered excitedly. \u201cI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cLight?\u201d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\u2019d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we allowed to speak yet?\u201d said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cNicolas Flamel,\u201d she whispered dramatically, \u201cis the only known maker of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone!\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t have quite the effect she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, honestly, don\u2019t you two read? Look\u2014read that, there.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\n\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).\n\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \u201cThe dog must be guarding Flamel\u2019s Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\u2019re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\u2019s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\u201cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo wonder Snape\u2019s after it! Anyone would want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no wonder we couldn\u2019t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly recent if he\u2019s six hundred and sixty five, is he?\u201d\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\u2019d do with a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone if they had one. It wasn\u2019t until Ron said he\u2019d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, all the Slytherins will think I\u2019m just too scared to face Snape. I\u2019ll show them\u2026 it\u2019ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as long as we\u2019re not wiping you off the field,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\u2019t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\u2019d found out about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone? Harry didn\u2019t see how he could\u2014yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\n\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\u2019d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker Curse. They\u2019d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s Locomotor Mortis,\u201d Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ron snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t nag.\u201d\n\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\u2019s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s out there!\u201d said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \u201cEven\u2014blimey\u2014Dumbledore\u2019s come to watch!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart did a somersault.\n\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief\u2014He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Snape look so mean,\u201d he told Hermione. \u201cLook they\u2019re off\u2014Ouch!\u201d\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cWonder how long Potter\u2019s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\n\u201cYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\u201d said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \u201cIt\u2019s people they feel sorry for. See, there\u2019s Potter, who\u2019s got no parents, then there\u2019s the Weasleys, who\u2019ve got no money\u2014you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\u2019ve got no brains.\u201d\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\u201d he stammered.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \u201cYou tell him, Neville.\u201d\n\n\u201cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\u2019d be poorer than Weasley, and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Malfoy\u2014one more word\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione suddenly, \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u2019s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\u201d said Malfoy.\n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape\u2014she didn\u2019t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches\u2014the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\n\u201cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\u2019s over! Harry\u2019s won! We\u2019ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\u201d shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d done it\u2014the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped\u2014then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\u2019s smiling face.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \u201cNice to see you haven\u2019t been brooding about that mirror\u2026 been keeping busy\u2026 excellent\u2026\u201d\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\u2019t ever remember feeling happier. He\u2019d really done something to be proud of now\u2014no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d shown Snape\u2026\n\nAnd speaking of Snape\u2026\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\u2019s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\u2019s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\u2014what was going on?\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\u2019t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\n\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\u2019t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u2019t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2026d-don\u2019t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I thought we\u2019d keep this private,\u201d said Snape, his voice icy. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, after all.\u201d\n\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\u2019s yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cB-b-but Severus, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\u201d said Snape, taking a step toward him.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\u201d\n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \u201c\u2014your little bit of hocus pocus. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cB-but I d-d-don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Snape cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another little chat soon, when you\u2019ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry, where have you been?\u201d Hermione squeaked.\n\n\u201cWe won! You won! We won!\u201d shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \u201cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He\u2019s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\u2019ll be all right\u2014talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\u2019s waiting for you in the common room, we\u2019re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that now,\u201d said Harry breathlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s find an empty room, you wait \u2019til you hear this\u2026\u201d\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\u2019t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\u2019d seen and heard.\n\n\u201cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, and Snape\u2019s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy\u2014and he said something about Quirrell\u2019s \u2018hocus pocus\u2019\u2014I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you mean the Stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\u201d said Hermione in alarm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\n\n\n14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\n\n\n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\u2019d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter.\n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\u2019t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\n\n\u201cHermione, the exams are ages away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen weeks,\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s not ages, that\u2019s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not six hundred years old,\u201d Ron reminded her. \u201cAnyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\u2019s an A.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\u2019re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me\u2026\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\u2019t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never remember this,\u201d Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\u2019d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\n\nHarry, who was looking up \u201cDittany\u201d in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\u2019t look up until he heard Ron say, \u201cHagrid! What are you doing in the library?\u201d\n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 lookin\u2019,\u201d he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \u201cAn\u2019 what\u2019re you lot up ter?\u201d He looked suddenly suspicious. \u201cYer not still lookin\u2019 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\u201d said Ron impressively. \u201cAnd we know what that dog\u2019s guarding, it\u2019s a Sorcerer\u2019s St\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \u201cDon\u2019 go shoutin\u2019 about it, what\u2019s the matter with yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\u201d said Harry, \u201cabout what\u2019s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHHHH!\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cListen\u2014come an\u2019 see me later, I\u2019m not promisin\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh anythin\u2019, mind, but don\u2019 go rabbitin\u2019 about it in here, students aren\u2019 s\u2019pposed ter know. They\u2019ll think I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you later, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid shuffled off.\n\n\u201cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see what section he was in,\u201d said Ron, who\u2019d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.\n\n\u201cDragons!\u201d he whispered. \u201cHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\u2019s Guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s against our laws,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\u2019 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\u2019s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\u2019re keeping dragons in the back garden\u2014anyway, you can\u2019t tame dragons, it\u2019s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\u2019s got off wild ones in Romania.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t wild dragons in Britain?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOf course there are,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\u2019ve spotted them, to make them forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what on earths Hagrid up to?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\u2019s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \u201cWho is it?\u201d before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014yeh wanted to ask me somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \u201cWe were wondering if you could tell us what\u2019s guarding the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone apart from Fluffy.\u201d\n\nHagrid frowned at him.\n\n\u201cO\u2019 course I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019 know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\u2019 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\u2019s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts\u2014I s\u2019ppose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\u201d said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\u2019s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \u201cWe only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 s\u2019pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 he borrowed Fluffy from me\u2026 then some o\u2019 the teachers did enchantments\u2026 Professor Sprout\u2014Professor Flitwick\u2014Professor McGonagall\u2014\u201d he ticked them off on his fingers, \u201cProfessor Quirrell\u2014an\u2019 Dumbledore himself did somethin\u2019, o\u2019 course. Hang on, I\u2019ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014yer not still on abou\u2019 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\u2019s not about ter steal it.\u201d\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything\u2014except, it seemed, Quirrell\u2019s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren\u2019t you, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry anxiously. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a soul knows except me an\u2019 Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid proudly.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d Harry muttered to the others. \u201cHagrid, can we have a window open? I\u2019m boiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \u201cThat\u2019s er\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \u201cIt must\u2019ve cost you a fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLas\u2019 night. I was down in the village havin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you going to do with it when it\u2019s hatched?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bin doin\u2019 some readin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \u201cGot this outta the library\u2014Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit\u2014it\u2019s a bit outta date, o\u2019 course, but it\u2019s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019 see here\u2014how ter recognize diff\u2019rent eggs\u2014what I got there\u2019s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\u2019re rare, them.\u201d\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n\n\u201cWonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u201d Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\u2019s hatching.\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lessons, we\u2019ll get into trouble, and that\u2019s nothing to what Hagrid\u2019s going to be in when someone finds out what he\u2019s doing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Harry whispered.\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\u2019t like the look on Malfoy\u2019s face at all.\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\u2019s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly out.\u201d He ushered them inside.\n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\u2019t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n\n\u201cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\u201d\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\u2014he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains\u2014it\u2019s a kid\u2014he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u201d\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\u2019s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\n\u201cJust let him go,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cSet him free.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHe\u2019s too little. He\u2019d die.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u201d said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \u201cHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry loudly, \u201cgive it two weeks and Norbert\u2019s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\u201d\n\nHagrid bit his lip.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I know I can\u2019t keep him forever, but I can\u2019t jus\u2019 dump him, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \u201cCharlie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m Ron, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014Charlie\u2014your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow about it, Hagrid?\u201d\n\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.\n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\n\n\u201cIt bit me!\u201d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\u201d\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hedwig!\u201d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \u201cShe\u2019ll have Charlie\u2019s answer!\u201d\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter\u2014I\u2019d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\u2019t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\u2019t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\u2019s still dark.\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\n\nLove,\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too difficult\u2014I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert\u2014and Malfoy.\n\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey\u2014would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were poisonous.\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just my hand,\u201d he whispered, \u201calthough that feels like it\u2019s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me\u2014I\u2019ve told her it was a dog, but I don\u2019t think she believes me. I shouldn\u2019t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\u201d said Hermione, but this didn\u2019t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\n\n\u201cMidnight on Saturday!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cOh no\u2014oh no\u2014I\u2019ve just remembered\u2014Charlie\u2019s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\u2019s going to know we\u2019re getting rid of Norbert.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione didn\u2019t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change the plan now,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\u2019ll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you in,\u201d he puffed. \u201cNorbert\u2019s at a tricky stage\u2014nothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n\nWhen they told him about Charlie\u2019s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\n\u201cAargh! It\u2019s all right, he only got my boot\u2014jus\u2019 playin\u2019\u2014he\u2019s only a baby, after all.\u201d\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\u2019t come quickly enough.\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn\u2019t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\u2019s hut because they\u2019d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\u2019d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got lots o\u2019 rats an\u2019 some brandy fer the journey,\u201d said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\u201d\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\n\u201cBye bye, Norbert!\u201d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \u201cMommy will never forget you!\u201d\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another\u2014even one of Harry\u2019s shortcuts didn\u2019t make the work much easier.\n\n\u201cNearly there!\u201d Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\n\u201cDetention!\u201d she shouted. \u201cAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\u2019s coming\u2014he\u2019s got a dragon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on\u2014I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\u201d\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\u2019d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got detention! I could sing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.\n\nCharlie\u2019s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\u2019d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going\u2026 going\u2026 gone.\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon\u2014Malfoy in detention\u2014what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n\n\n\n\nThings couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\u2019t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \u201cI was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\n\n\u201cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\u2019s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\u201d\n\nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville\u2014Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFour students out of bed in one night! I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions\u2014yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\u2019s very dangerous\u2014and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty?\u201d Harry gasped\u2014they would lose the lead, the lead he\u2019d won in the last Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cFifty points each,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\n\n\u201cProfessor\u2014please\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\u201d\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\u2019d done?\n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \u201cThanks, Potter, we owe you one!\u201d\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\u2019ve been here, and people still like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\u201d said Harry miserably.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014no,\u201d Ron admitted.\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t his business from now on. He\u2019d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\n\n\u201cResign?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat good\u2019ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\u2019t win at Quidditch?\u201d\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \u201cthe Seeker.\u201d\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as well known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions\u2026\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014not again, please\u2014\u201d\n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014all right\u2014\u201d he heard Quirrell sob.\n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\u2019d promised himself about not meddling.\n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step\u2014Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s done it, then!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf Quirrell\u2019s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still Fluffy, though,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cMaybe Snape\u2019s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\u201d said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \u201cI bet there\u2019s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\u201d\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\n\n\u201cGo to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got no proof!\u201d said Harry. \u201cQuirrell\u2019s too scared to back us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he doesn\u2019t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor\u2014who do you think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\u2019ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life depended on it, he\u2019s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\u2019ll think. And don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u201d\n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf we just do a bit of poking around\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly, \u201cwe\u2019ve done enough poking around.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.\n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven o\u2019clock tonight.\n\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\u2019t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\u2019d got.\n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock that night, they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\u2014and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\n\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\u2019t you, eh?\u201d he said, leering at them. \u201cOh yes\u2026 hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me\u2026 It\u2019s just a pity they let the old punishments die out\u2026 hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\u2019ve got the chains still in my office, keep \u2019em well oiled in case they\u2019re ever needed\u2026 Right, off we go, and don\u2019t think of running off, now, it\u2019ll be worse for you if you do.\u201d\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding so delighted.\n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \u201cI suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy\u2014it\u2019s into the forest you\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one piece.\u201d\n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n\u201cThe forest?\u201d he repeated, and he didn\u2019t sound quite as cool as usual. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there at night\u2014there\u2019s all sorts of things in there\u2014werewolves, I heard.\u201d\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\u2019s robe and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \u201cShould\u2019ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cAbou\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI bin waitin\u2019 fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\u201d said Filch coldly, \u201cthey\u2019re here to be punished, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yer late, is it?\u201d said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \u201cBin lecturin\u2019 them, eh? \u2019Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\u2019ve done yer bit, I\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back at dawn,\u201d said Filch, \u201cfor what\u2019s left of them,\u201d he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in that forest,\u201d he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\n\n\u201cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\u201d said Hagrid fiercely. \u201cYeh\u2019ve done wrong an\u2019 now yeh\u2019ve got ter pay fer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is servant stuff, it\u2019s not for students to do. I thought we\u2019d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014tell yer that\u2019s how it is at Hogwarts,\u201d Hagrid growled. \u201cCopyin\u2019 lines! What good\u2019s that ter anyone? Yeh\u2019ll do summat useful or yeh\u2019ll get out. If yeh think yer father\u2019d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\u2019 pack. Go on.\u201d\n\nMalfoy didn\u2019t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cnow, listen carefully, \u2019cause it\u2019s dangerous what we\u2019re gonna do tonight, an\u2019 I don\u2019 want no one takin\u2019 risks. Follow me over here a moment.\u201d\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\n\n\u201cLook there,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201csee that stuff shinin\u2019 on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\u2019s unicorn blood. There\u2019s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\u201d said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 that lives in the forest that\u2019ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\u2019re gonna split inter two parties an\u2019 follow the trail in diff\u2019rent directions. There\u2019s blood all over the place, it must\u2019ve bin staggerin\u2019 around since last night at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want Fang,\u201d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\u2019s long teeth.\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\u2019s a coward,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cSo me, Harry, an\u2019 Hermione\u2019ll go one way an\u2019 Draco, Neville, an\u2019 Fang\u2019ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\u2019ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\u2019 practice now\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014an\u2019 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\u2019 we\u2019ll all come an\u2019 find yeh\u2014so, be careful\u2014let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves.\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n\n\u201cCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cNot fast enough,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\u201d\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Hermione?\u201d Hagrid whispered. \u201cDon\u2019 worry, it can\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt, an\u2019 then we\u2019ll be able ter\u2014GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s summat in here that shouldn\u2019 be.\u201d\n\n\u201cA werewolf?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019 no werewolf an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 no unicorn, neither,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cRight, follow me, but careful, now.\u201d\n\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Hagrid called. \u201cShow yerself\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nAnd into the clearing came\u2014was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\u2019s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\u2019s jaws dropped.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid in relief. \u201cHow are yeh?\u201d\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\u201d said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \u201cWere you going to shoot me?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \u201cThere\u2019s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\u2019 Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\u2019 this is Ronan, you two. He\u2019s a centaur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d noticed,\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d said Hermione timidly.\n\n\u201cA bit. Well, that\u2019s something.\u201d Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \u201cMars is bright tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \u201cListen, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \u2019cause there\u2019s a unicorn bin hurt\u2014you seen anythin\u2019?\u201d\n\nRonan didn\u2019t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\n\n\u201cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut have yeh seen anythin\u2019, Ronan? Anythin\u2019 unusual?\u201d\n\n\u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \u201cUnusually bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I was meanin\u2019 anythin\u2019 unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \u201cSo yeh haven\u2019t noticed anythin\u2019 strange?\u201d\n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \u201cThe forest hides many secrets.\u201d\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.\n\n\u201cHullo, Bane,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell enough. Look, I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin askin\u2019 Ronan, you seen anythin\u2019 odd in here lately? There\u2019s a unicorn bin injured\u2014would yeh know anythin\u2019 about it?\u201d\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Hagrid grumpily. \u201cWell, if either of you do see anythin\u2019, let me know, won\u2019t yeh? We\u2019ll be off, then.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Hagrid irritably, \u201ctry an\u2019 get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\u2019 closer\u2019n the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many of them in here?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, a fair few\u2026 Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\u2019re good enough about turnin\u2019 up if ever I want a word. They\u2019re deep mind, centaurs\u2026 they know things\u2026 jus\u2019 don\u2019 let on much.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\u2019s bin killin\u2019 the unicorns\u2014never heard anythin\u2019 like it before.\u201d\n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two wait here!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cStay on the path, I\u2019ll come back for yeh!\u201d\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\u2019t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been hurt, do you?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Malfoy has, but if something\u2019s got Neville\u2026 it\u2019s our fault he\u2019s here in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two were makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups\u2014Neville, you stay with me an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019ll have a harder time frightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n\n\u201cLook\u2014\u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves.\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered\u2026 Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\u2019s side, and began to drink its blood.\n\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted\u2014so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry\u2014unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry\u2014he couldn\u2019t move for fear.\n\nThen a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and a palomino body.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014thank you\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time\u2014especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.\n\n\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\n\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you realize who this is?\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been telling him?\u201d growled Bane. \u201cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\u201d\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\u201d he said in his gloomy voice.\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\n\u201cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\u201d\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\n\u201cDo you not see that unicorn?\u201d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \u201cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u201d\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s Bane so angry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\u201d\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\u2019s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u201cWe\u2019ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed, \u201cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else\u2014something that will bring you back to full strength and power\u2014something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! Of course\u2014the Elixir of Life! But I don\u2019t understand who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u201d\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Harry croaked, \u201cthat was Vol\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\u201d\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \u201cThe unicorn\u2019s dead, Hagrid, it\u2019s in that clearing back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \u201cYou are safe now.\u201d\n\nHarry slid off his back.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry Potter,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\u201d\n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\n\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\n\u201cSnape wants the stone for Voldemort\u2026 and Voldemort\u2019s waiting in the forest\u2026 and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying the name!\u201d said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\u2019t have done so\u2026 Bane was furious\u2026 he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen\u2026 They must show that Voldemort\u2019s coming back\u2026 Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me\u2026 I suppose that\u2019s written in the stars as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you stop saying the name!\u201d Ron hissed.\n\n\u201cSo all I\u2019ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\u201d Harry went on feverishly, \u201cthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off\u2026 Well, I suppose Bane\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n\n\u201cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\u2019t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\u2019s a very imprecise branch of magic.\u201d\n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\u2019s surprises weren\u2019t over.\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\n\nJust in case.\n\n\n\n\n\n16. THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\n\n\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\u2014points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\n\nMaybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\u2019t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the rest.\n\n\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \u201cI needn\u2019t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u201d\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \u201cNo more studying,\u201d Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \u201cYou could look more cheerful, Harry, we\u2019ve got a week before we find out how badly we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\u201d\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew what this means!\u201d he burst out angrily. \u201cMy scar keeps hurting\u2014it\u2019s happened before, but never as often as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ill,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a warning\u2026 it means danger\u2019s coming\u2026\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t get worked up, it was too hot.\n\n\u201cHarry, relax, Hermione\u2019s right, the Stone\u2019s safe as long as Dumbledore\u2019s around. Anyway, we\u2019ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\u2019s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\u2019d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \u201cThat\u2019s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\u2019d done that one.\u201d\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\u2019t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy\u2026 never\u2026 but\u2026\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d said Ron sleepily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d said Harry. He had turned white. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \u201cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\u2019t answer.\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\u2019ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Hagrid casually, \u201che wouldn\u2019 take his cloak off.\u201d\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head\u2014that\u2019s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\u2019 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\u201d\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \u201cWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cMighta come up,\u201d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \u201cYeah\u2026 he asked what I did, an\u2019 I told him I was gamekeeper here\u2026 He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after\u2026 so I told him\u2026 an\u2019 I said what I\u2019d always really wanted was a dragon\u2026 an\u2019 then\u2026 I can\u2019 remember too well, \u2019cause he kept buyin\u2019 me drinks\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\u2019 we could play cards fer it if I wanted\u2026 but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home\u2026 So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did he\u2014did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u201d Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014yeah\u2014how many three headed dogs d\u2019yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a piece o\u2019 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\u2019 play him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll go straight off ter sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u201d he blurted out. \u201cForget I said it! Hey\u2014where\u2019re yeh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\u2019t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak\u2014it must\u2019ve been easy, once he\u2019d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\u2019t stop him. Where\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to\u2014\u201d Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you three doing inside?\u201d\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\n\u201cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\n\u201cSee Professor Dumbledore?\u201d Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed\u2014now what?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of secret,\u201d he said, but he wished at once he hadn\u2019t, because Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils flared.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \u201cProfessor\u2014it\u2019s about the Sorcerer\u2019s stone\u2014\u201d\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\u2019t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\u2019t pick them up. \u201cHow do you know ?\u201d she spluttered.\n\n\u201cProfessor, I think\u2014I know\u2014that Sn\u2014that someone\u2019s going to try and steal the Stone. I\u2019ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\u2019s too well protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \u201cI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \u201cSnape\u2019s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\u2019s found out everything he needs, and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what can we\u2014\u201d\n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n\nSnape was standing there.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said smoothly.\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this,\u201d he said, with an odd, twisted smile.\n\n\u201cWe were\u2014\u201d Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n\n\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHanging around like this, people will think you\u2019re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\u2019t afford to lose any more points, can it?\u201d\n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n\n\u201cBe warned, Potter\u2014any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\u201d\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n\n\u201cRight, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape\u2014wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\u201d He put on a high voice, \u201c\u2018Oh Professor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d better stay outside the third floor corridor,\u201d Harry told Ron. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nBut that part of the plan didn\u2019t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n\n\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\u201d she stormed. \u201cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\u2019ve come anywhere near here again, I\u2019ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \u201cAt least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u201d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry!\u201d she wailed. \u201cSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\u2019ve only just got away, I don\u2019t know where Snape went.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out of here tonight and I\u2019m going to try and get to the Stone first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAfter what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\u2019ll be expelled!\u201d\n\n\u201cSO WHAT?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\u2019s coming back! Haven\u2019t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\u2019t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter anymore, can\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side! I\u2019m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\u201d\n\nHe glared at them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Harry,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s just lucky I got it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it cover all three of us?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAll\u2014all three of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, you don\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione briskly. \u201cHow do you think you\u2019d get to the Stone without us? I\u2019d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\u2019re not throwing me out after that.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\u2019t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n\n\u201cBetter get the cloak,\u201d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy\u2014he didn\u2019t feel much like singing.\n\nHe ran back down to the common room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\u2014if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\u2019d been making another bid for freedom.\n\n\u201cNothing, Neville, nothing,\u201d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going out again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, Neville?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go out,\u201d said Neville, \u201cyou\u2019ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthis is important.\u201d\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you do it,\u201d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d Ron exploded, \u201cget away from that hole and don\u2019t be an idiot\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u201d said Neville. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but not to us,\u201d said Ron in exasperation. \u201cNeville, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.\n\n\u201cGo on then, try and hit me!\u201d said Neville, raising his fists. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cDo something,\u201d he said desperately.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u201d\n\nShe raised her wand.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n\nNeville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done to him?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the full Body Bind,\u201d said Hermione miserably. \u201cOh, Neville, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u201d said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\u2019s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u201d Ron whispered in Harry\u2019s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThey didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \u201cKnow you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u201d\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n\n\u201cShould call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a creeping around unseen.\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\u201d\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n\n\u201cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\u201d he said greasily. \u201cMy mistake, my mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t see you\u2014of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible\u2014forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have business here, Peeves,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cStay away from this place tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\u201d said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \u201cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u201d\n\nAnd he scooted off.\n\n\u201cBrilliant, Harry!\u201d whispered Ron.\n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridor\u2014and the door was already ajar.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d Harry said quietly, \u201cSnape\u2019s already got past Fluffy.\u201d\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can take the cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry pushed the door open.\n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that at its feet?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cLooks like a harp,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape must have left it there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, here goes\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\u2019s growls ceased\u2014it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n\n\u201cKeep playing,\u201d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\u2019s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u201d said Ron, peering over the dog\u2019s back. \u201cWant to go first, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n\n\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Hermione said anxiously.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2014just black\u2014there\u2019s no way of climbing down, we\u2019ll just have to drop.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\n\n\u201cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\u201d\n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cSee you in a minute, I hope\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and\u2014\n\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \u201cit\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u201d\n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff?\u201d were his first words.\n\n\u201cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\u201d\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\u2019s other side.\n\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLucky!\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cLook at you both!\u201d\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.\n\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what this is\u2014it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a great help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\n\n\u201cDevil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare\u2026 what did Professor Sprout say?\u2014it likes the dark and the damp\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo light a fire!\u201d Harry choked.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014of course\u2014but there\u2019s no wood!\u201d Hermione cried, wringing her hands.\n\n\u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u201d Ron bellowed. \u201cARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\n\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a crisis\u2014\u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully grown dragon\u2014Norbert had been bad enough\u2026\n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 sounds like wings to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead\u2014I can see something moving.\u201d\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once\u2026 well, there\u2019s no other choice\u2026 I\u2019ll run.\u201d\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThese birds\u2026 they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering\u2014glittering?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re keys! Winged keys\u2014look carefully. So that must mean\u2026\u201d he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \u201c\u2026yes\u2014look! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are hundreds of them!\u201d\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a big, old fashioned one\u2014probably silver, like the handle.\u201d\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\u2019t. After a minute\u2019s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\n\u201cThat one!\u201d he called to the others. \u201cThat big one\u2014there\u2014no, there\u2014with bright blue wings\u2014the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\u201d\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to close in on it!\u201d Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \u201cRon, you come at it from above\u2014Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\u2019ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\u201d\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned\u2014it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly\u2014the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way across the room.\u201d\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Hermione nervously.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to be chessmen.\u201d\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\u2019s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\u201cDo we\u2014er\u2014have to join you to get across?\u201d The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cThis needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\u2019ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not offended,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cJust tell us what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go next to him instead of that castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a knight,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n\n\u201cWhite always plays first in chess,\u201d said Ron, peering across the board. \u201cYes\u2026 look\u2026\u201d\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014move diagonally four squares to the right.\u201d\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.\n\n\u201cHad to let that happen,\u201d said Ron, looking shaken. \u201cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\u201d\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cLet me think\u2014let me think\u2026\u201d\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Ron softly, \u201cIt\u2019s the only way\u2026 I\u2019ve got to be taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s chess!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\u2019ll take me\u2014that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t hurry up, he\u2019ll already have the Stone!\u201d\n\nThere was no alternative.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Ron called, his face pale but determined. \u201cHere I go\u2014now, don\u2019t hang around once you\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor\u2014Hermione screamed but stayed on her square\u2014the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\u2019d been knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\u2019s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\n\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, trying to convince himself. \u201cWhat do you reckon\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare; Flitwick must\u2019ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThey had reached another door.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHarry pushed it open.\n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u201d Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \u201cCome on, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next\u2014but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\u2019t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\n\n\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\n\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n\n\n\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\u2019s left side;\n\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\n\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n\n\n\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n\n\n\n\n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis isn\u2019t magic\u2014it\u2019s logic\u2014a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t got an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be stuck in here forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut so will we, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cEverything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we know which to drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d\n\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fire\u2014toward the Stone.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough there for one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly one swallow.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\u201d\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n\n\u201cYou drink that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\u2019ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy\u2014go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\u2019m no match for him, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry\u2014what if You-Know-Who\u2019s with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I was lucky once, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry, pointing at his scar. \u201cI might get lucky again.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014you\u2019re a great wizard, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you,\u201d said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBooks! And cleverness! There are more important things\u2014friendship and bravery and\u2014oh Harry\u2014be careful!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou drink first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou are sure which is which, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poison?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014but it\u2019s like ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, go, before it wears off.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck\u2014take care.\u201d\n\n\u201cGO!\u201d\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\n\n\u201cHere I come,\u201d he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\u2019t feel them\u2014for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\u2014then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there\u2014but it wasn\u2019t Snape. It wasn\u2019t even Voldemort.\n\n\n\n\n\n17. THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\n\n\n\nIt was Quirrell.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\u2019t twitching at all.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI wondered whether I\u2019d be meeting you here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought\u2014Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus?\u201d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\u2019t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \u201cYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\u2019t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take it in. This couldn\u2019t be true, it couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut Snape tried to kill me!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\u2019d have got you off that broom. I\u2019d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\u2019t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape was trying to save me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Quirrell coolly. \u201cWhy do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t do it again. Funny, really\u2026 he needn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular\u2026 and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u201d\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\u2019d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let the troll in?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls\u2014you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off\u2014and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three headed dog didn\u2019t even manage to bite Snape\u2019s leg off properly.\n\n\u201cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\u201d\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\n\u201cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\u201d Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \u201cTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like this\u2026 but he\u2019s in London\u2026 I\u2019ll be far away by the time he gets back\u2026\u201d\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\n\n\u201cI saw you and Snape in the forest\u2014\u201d he blurted out.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \u201cHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\u2019d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me\u2014as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n\n\u201cI see the Stone\u2026 I\u2019m presenting it to my master\u2026 but where is it?\u201d\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\u2019t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\n\u201cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he does,\u201d said Quirrell casually, \u201cheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\u2019t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing\u2014I thought Snape was threatening you\u2026\u201d\n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI find it hard to follow my master\u2019s instructions\u2014he is a great wizard and I am weak\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHe is with me wherever I go,\u201d said Quirrell quietly. \u201cI met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it\u2026 Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\u201d Quirrell shivered suddenly. \u201cHe does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me\u2026 decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He\u2019d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mind was racing.\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it\u2014which means I\u2019ll see where it\u2019s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\u2019m up to?\n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\n\n\u201cUse the boy\u2026 Use the boy\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014Potter\u2014come here.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Quirrell repeated. \u201cLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nHarry walked toward him.\n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\u2019s all.\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket\u2014and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow\u2014incredibly\u2014he\u2019d gotten the Stone.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impatiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\nHarry screwed up his courage.\n\n\u201cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u201d he invented. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nQuirrell cursed again.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips.\n\n\u201cHe lies\u2026 He lies\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me the truth! What did you just see?\u201d\n\nThe high voice spoke again.\n\n\u201cLet me speak to him\u2026 face-to-face\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, you are not strong enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have strength enough\u2026 for this\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter\u2026\u201d it whispered.\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the face said. \u201cMere shadow and vapor\u2026 I have form only when I can share another\u2019s body\u2026 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds\u2026 Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks\u2026 you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest\u2026 and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own\u2026 Now\u2026 why don\u2019t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\u201d\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\u2019s legs. He stumbled backward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d snarled the face. \u201cBetter save your own life and join me\u2026 or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents\u2026 They died begging me for mercy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted suddenly.\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.\n\n\u201cHow touching\u2026\u201d it hissed. \u201cI always value bravery\u2026 Yes, boy, your parents were brave\u2026 I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight\u2026 but your mother needn\u2019t have died\u2026 she was trying to protect you\u2026 Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \u201cSEIZE HIM!\u201d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened\u2014he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers\u2014they were blistering before his eyes.\n\n\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\u2019s neck\u2014Harry\u2019s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\n\u201cMaster, I cannot hold him\u2014my hands\u2014my hands!\u201d\n\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms\u2014Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\n\u201cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\u201d screeched Voldemort.\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain\u2014his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off\u2014the pain in Harry\u2019s head was building\u2014he couldn\u2019t see\u2014he could only hear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s yells of, \u201cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d and other voices, maybe in Harry\u2019s own head, crying, \u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down\u2026 down\u2026 down\u2026\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\n\nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \u201cSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who does? Sir, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\n\u201cTokens from your friends and admirers,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have I been in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sit, the Stone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feared I might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou nearly were, I couldn\u2019t have kept him off the Stone much longer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Stone, boy, you\u2014the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cBut your friend\u2014Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know about Nicolas?\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \u201cYou did do the thing properly, didn\u2019t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cTo one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all\u2014the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\u201d\n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 sir\u2014even if the Stone\u2019s gone, Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\u2019s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he hasn\u2019t gone, has he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share\u2026 not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time\u2014and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \u201cSir, there are some other things I\u2019d like to know, if you can tell me\u2026 things I want to know the truth about\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d Dumbledore sighed. \u201cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\u2019ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\u201d\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n\n\u201cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day\u2026 put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older\u2026 I know you hate to hear this\u2026 when you are ready, you will know.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\u201cBut why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t realize that love as powerful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign\u2026 to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\u201d\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \u201cAnd the Invisibility Cloak\u2014do you know who sent it to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2014your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cUseful things\u2026 your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s something else\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFire away.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirrell said Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, him\u2014Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saved his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore dreamily. \u201cFunny, the way people\u2019s minds work, isn\u2019t it? Professor Snape couldn\u2019t bear being in your father\u2019s debt\u2026 I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\u2019s memory in peace\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\n\n\u201cAnd sir, there\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, now, I\u2019m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\u2019s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone\u2014find it, but not use it\u2014would be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes\u2026 Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve rather lost my liking for them\u2014but I think I\u2019ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \u201cAlas! Ear wax!\u201d\n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\n\n\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Harry pleaded.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let Professor Dumbledore in\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut five minutes only.\u201d\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to\u2014Dumbledore was so worried\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s talking about it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat really happened?\u201d\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\u2019s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\u201cSo the Stone\u2019s gone?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cFlamel\u2019s just going to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that\u2014what was it?\u2014\u2018to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI always said he was off his rocker,\u201d said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to you two?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I got back all right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI brought Ron round\u2014that took a while\u2014and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall\u2014he already knew\u2014he just said, \u2018Harry\u2019s gone after him, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019 and hurtled off to the third floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he meant you to do it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cSending you your father\u2019s cloak and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione exploded, \u201cif he did\u2014I mean to say that\u2019s terrible\u2014you could have been killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\u2019s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Dumbledore\u2019s off his rocker, all right,\u201d said Ron proudly. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course\u2014you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you\u2014but the food\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\u201d she said firmly.\n\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the feast,\u201d he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \u201cI can, can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\u201d she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\u2019t realize how risky feasts could be. \u201cAnd you have another visitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014all\u2014my\u2014ruddy\u2014fault!\u201d he sobbed, his face in his hands. \u201cI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\u2019t know, an\u2019 I told him! Yeh could\u2019ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\u2019ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\u2019 made ter live as a Muggle!\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \u201cHagrid, he\u2019d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\u2019re talking about, he\u2019d have found out even if you hadn\u2019t told him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh could\u2019ve died!\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 say the name!\u201d\n\n\u201cVOLDEMORT!\u201d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \u201cI\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\u2019ve got loads\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \u201cThat reminds me. I\u2019ve got yeh a present.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\u201d said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\n\n\u201cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \u2019Course, he shoulda sacked me instead\u2014anyway, got yeh this\u2026\u201d\n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\n\n\u201cSent owls off ter all yer parents\u2019 old school friends, askin\u2019 fer photos\u2026 knew yeh didn\u2019 have any\u2026 d\u2019yeh like it?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t speak, but Hagrid understood.\n\nHarry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\u2019s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\u2019s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\n\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u201cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were\u2026 you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts\u2026\n\n\u201cNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\u201d\n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, recent events must be taken into account.\u201d\n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little.\n\n\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes\u2026\n\n\u201cFirst\u2014to Mr. Ronald Weasley\u2026\u201d\n\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n\n\u201c\u2026for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \u201cMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\u2019s giant chess set!\u201d\n\nAt last there was silence again.\n\n\u201cSecond\u2014to Miss Hermione Granger\u2026 for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves\u2014they were a hundred points up.\n\n\u201cThird\u2014to Mr. Harry Potter\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet \u201c\u2026for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\u201d\n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points\u2014exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup\u2014if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of courage,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\u201d\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \u201cwe need a little change of decoration.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s feelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls\u2026 he would never, ever forget tonight.\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life.\n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us these,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross Station.\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\u2019t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\n\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron, \u201cboth of you\u2014I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look forward to.\u201d People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\n\n\u201cBye, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cStill famous,\u201d said Ron, grinning at him.\n\n\u201cNot where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \u201cThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!\u201d\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she wasn\u2019t pointing at Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook, Mom! I can see\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\n\u201cBusy year?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was nothing, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady, are you?\u201d\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou must be Harry\u2019s family!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cHurry up, boy, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d He walked away.\n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cSee you over the summer, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope you have\u2014er\u2014a good holiday,\u201d said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re not allowed to use magic at home. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\nSay you\u2019ve spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J. K. Rowling\u2019s enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. In the nonmagic human world\u2014the world of \u201cMuggles\u201d\u2014Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he\u2019s quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley.\n\nA mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: \u201cWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, \u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig\u2026 and that\u2019s where the real adventure\u2014humorous, haunting, and suspenseful\u2014begins.

K. version of the Newbery Medal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jessica, who loves stories,\n\nFor Anne, who loved them too;\n\nAnd for Di, who heard this one first.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. THE BOY WHO LIVED\n\n\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n\n\u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar\u2014a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen\u2014then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive\u2014no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes\u2014the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt\u2014these people were obviously collecting for something\u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes, their son, Harry\u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking\u2026 no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her\u2014if he\u2019d had a sister like that\u2026 but all the same, those people in cloaks\u2026\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\u2014and it didn\u2019t improve his mood\u2014was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\n\u201cAnd finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early\u2014it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters\u2026\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr\u2014Petunia, dear\u2014you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n\u201cWell, I just thought\u2026 maybe\u2026 it was something to do with\u2026 you know\u2026 her crowd.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son\u2014he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did\u2026 if it got out that they were related to a pair of\u2014well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind\u2026 He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on\u2014he yawned and turned over\u2014it couldn\u2019t affect them\u2026\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\u2014the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\n\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n\u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no\u2014even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent\u2014I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense\u2014for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you haven\u2019t\u201d, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You Know\u2014oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re too\u2014well\u2014noble to use them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying,\u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are\u2014are\u2014that they\u2019re\u2014dead.\u201d\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\u201cLily and James\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to believe it\u2026 Oh, Albus\u2026\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u201cI know\u2026 I know\u2026\u201d he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potter\u2019s son, Harry. But\u2014he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke\u2014and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s true?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done\u2026 all the people he\u2019s killed\u2026 he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding\u2026 of all the things to stop him\u2026 but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may never know.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all places?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014you can\u2019t mean the people who live here?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore\u2014you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got this son\u2014I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous\u2014a legend\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future\u2014there will be books written about Harry\u2014every child in our world will know his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes\u2014yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2014wise\u2014to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky\u2014and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild\u2014long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir\u2014house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\u201cIs that where\u2014?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that scar forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well\u2014give him here, Hagrid\u2014we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cCould I\u2014could I say good bye to him, sir?\u201d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the Muggles!\u201d\n\n\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-can\u2019t stand it\u2014Lily an\u2019 James dead\u2014an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be takin\u2019 Sirius his bike back. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall\u2014Professor Dumbledore, sir.\u201d\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\n\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley\u2026 He couldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Potter\u2014the boy who lived!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE VANISHING GLASS\n\n\n\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets\u2014but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s birthday\u2014how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise\u2014unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask questions\u2014that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way\u2014all over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\u2014Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\n\u201cThirty six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, thirty seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\u201d\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty\u2026 thirty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction.\n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there\u2014or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug.\n\n\u201cWhat about what\u2019s her name, your friend\u2014Yvonne?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon.\n\n\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she snarled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026and leave him in the car\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying\u2014it had been years since he\u2019d really cried\u2014but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 want\u2026 him\u2026 t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang\u2014\u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically\u2014and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy\u2014any funny business, anything at all\u2014and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls)\u2014The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\n\n\u201c\u2026roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon\u2014they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can\u2014but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself\u2014no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see\u2014so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened\u2014one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come\u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo\u2014cupboard\u2014stay\u2014no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\n\n\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n\n\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it\u2014it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings\u2019 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High\u2014like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and\u2014a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives\u2014he didn\u2019t belong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\n\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\n\n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\n\n\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d said Dudley suddenly. \u201cDad, Harry\u2019s got something!\u201d\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness\u2014Vernon!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley.\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n\n\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address\u2014how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching\u2014spying\u2014might be following us,\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an answer\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s best\u2026 we won\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we swear when we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\u201d\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my cupboard on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, Harry\u2014about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking\u2026 you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it\u2026 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there\u2026 I need that room\u2026 make him get out\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cGo to your cupboard\u2014I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley\u2014go\u2014just go.\u201d\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat\u2014something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\n\u201cI want\u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno damn letters today\u2014\u201d\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one\u2014\n\n\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n\n\u201cShake \u2019em off\u2026 shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television programs he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering\u2026\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\n\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great Humberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u201d\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday\u2014and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television\u2014then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun\u2014last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.\n\n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds\u2026 twenty\u2026 ten\u2026 nine\u2014maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him\u2014three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\n\n\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cannon?\u201d he said stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands\u2014now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then\u2014\n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy journey\u2026\u201d\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n\n\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\n\u201cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are breaking and entering!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n\n\u201cAnyway\u2014Harry,\u201d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here\u2014I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u201d\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u2019s whole arm.\n\n\u201cWhat about that tea then, eh?\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together. \u201cI\u2019d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\u2019ve got it, mind.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath.\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n\u201cYer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019 anymore, Dursley, don\u2019 worry.\u201d\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\n\u201cCall me Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone does. An\u2019 like I told yeh, I\u2019m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts\u2014yeh\u2019ll know all about Hogwarts, o\u2019 course.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014no,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said quickly.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019 s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\u2019t gettin\u2019 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\u2019t even know abou\u2019 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll what?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cALL WHAT?\u201d Hagrid thundered. \u201cNow wait jus\u2019 one second!\u201d\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n\u201cDo you mean ter tell me,\u201d he growled at the Dursleys, \u201cthat this boy\u2014this boy!\u2014knows nothin\u2019 abou\u2019\u2014about ANYTHING?\u201d\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u201cI know some things,\u201d he said. \u201cI can, you know, do math and stuff.\u201d But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \u201cAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u2019 world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\n\u201cDURSLEY!\u201d he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \u201cMimblewimble.\u201d Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n\n\u201cBut yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re famous. You\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? My\u2014my mom and dad weren\u2019t famous, were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know\u2026 yeh don\u2019 know\u2026\u201d Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know what yeh are?\u201d he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he commanded. \u201cStop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\u201d\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\n\n\u201cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\u2019 you\u2019ve kept it from him all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cKept what from me?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\u201cAh, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry\u2014yer a wizard.\u201d\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d gasped Harry.\n\n\u201cA wizard, o\u2019 course,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \u201can\u2019 a thumpin\u2019 good\u2019un, I\u2019d say, once yeh\u2019ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\u2019 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\u2019 I reckon it\u2019s abou\u2019 time yeh read yer letter.\u201d\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut on the Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\n\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\u2019s head like fireworks and he couldn\u2019t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \u201cWhat does it mean, they await my owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cGallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl\u2014a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl\u2014a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going,\u201d he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry, interested.\n\n\u201cA Muggle,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cit\u2019s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\u2019 it\u2019s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\u2019 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe swore when we took him in we\u2019d put a stop to that rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cswore we\u2019d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou knew I\u2019m a\u2014a wizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew!\u201d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \u201cKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that\u2014that school\u2014and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was\u2014a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\u201d\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n\n\u201cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\u2019d be just the same, just as strange, just as\u2014as\u2014abnormal\u2014and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\u201d\n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \u201cBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\u201d\n\n\u201cCAR CRASH!\u201d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \u201cHow could a car crash kill Lily an\u2019 James Potter? It\u2019s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\u2019 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why? What happened?\u201d Harry asked urgently.\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\u2019s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\n\n\u201cI never expected this,\u201d he said, in a low, worried voice. \u201cI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\u2019 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\u2019t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u2019 know if I\u2019m the right person ter tell yeh\u2014but someone\u2019s gotta\u2014yeh can\u2019t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh\u2014mind, I can\u2019t tell yeh everythin\u2019, it\u2019s a great myst\u2019ry, parts of it\u2026\u201d\n\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \u201cIt begins, I suppose, with\u2014with a person called\u2014but it\u2019s incredible yeh don\u2019t know his name, everyone in our world knows\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I don\u2019 like sayin\u2019 the name if I can help it. No one does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cGulpin\u2019 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went\u2026 bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\n\n\u201cCould you write it down?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cNah can\u2019t spell it. All right\u2014Voldemort.\u201d Hagrid shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again. Anyway, this\u2014this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\u2019 fer followers. Got \u2019em, too\u2014some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\u2019 his power, \u2019cause he was gettin\u2019 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\u2019t know who ter trust, didn\u2019t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches\u2026 terrible things happened. He was takin\u2019 over. \u2019Course, some stood up to him\u2014an\u2019 he killed \u2019em. Horribly. One o\u2019 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u2019t dare try takin\u2019 the school, not jus\u2019 then, anyway.\n\n\u201cNow, yer mum an\u2019 dad were as good a witch an\u2019 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\u2019 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\u2019ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get \u2019em on his side before\u2026 probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\u2019 ter do with the Dark Side.\n\n\u201cMaybe he thought he could persuade \u2019em\u2026 maybe he just wanted \u2019em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\u2019\u2014an\u2019\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s that sad\u2014knew yer mum an\u2019 dad, an\u2019 nicer people yeh couldn\u2019t find\u2014anyway\u2026\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who killed \u2019em. An\u2019 then\u2014an\u2019 this is the real myst\u2019ry of the thing\u2014he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\u2019 by then. But he couldn\u2019t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u2019s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh\u2014took care of yer mum an\u2019 dad an\u2019 yer house, even\u2014but it didn\u2019t work on you, an\u2019 that\u2019s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u2018em, no one except you, an\u2019 he\u2019d killed some o\u2019 the best witches an\u2019 wizards of the age\u2014the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts\u2014an\u2019 you was only a baby, an\u2019 you lived.\u201d\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u2019s mind. As Hagrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before\u2014and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\n\n\u201cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\u2019s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLoad of old tosh,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\n\n\u201cNow, you listen here, boy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cI accept there\u2019s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\u2019t have cured\u2014and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\u2019s better off without them in my opinion\u2014asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types\u2014just what I expected, always knew they\u2019d come to a sticky end\u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dursley\u2014I\u2019m warning you\u2014one more word\u2026\u201d\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\n\n\u201cBut what happened to Vol\u2014, sorry\u2014I mean, You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u2019s the biggest myst\u2019ry, see\u2026 he was gettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful\u2014why\u2019d he go?\n\n\u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\u2019s still out there, bidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. Don\u2019 reckon they could\u2019ve done if he was comin\u2019 back.\n\n\u201cMost of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause somethin\u2019 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he hadn\u2019t counted on\u2014I dunno what it was, no one does\u2014but somethin\u2019 about you stumped him, all right.\u201d\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time they\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI think you must have made a mistake. I don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\n\u201cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it\u2026 every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry\u2026 chased by Dudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach\u2026 dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow back\u2026 and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him?\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry Potter, not a wizard\u2014you wait, you\u2019ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a fight.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u201d he hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to Stonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish\u2014spell books and wands and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop him,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cStop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s son goin\u2019 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u2019s been down ever since he was born. He\u2019s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\u2019t know himself. He\u2019ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \u201cNEVER,\u201d he thundered, \u201c\u2014INSULT\u2014ALBUS\u2014DUMBLEDORE\u2014IN\u2014FRONT\u2014OF\u2014ME!\u201d\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\u2014there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\u2019s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019ta lost me temper,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\u2019t much left ter do.\u201d\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n\u201cBe grateful if yeh didn\u2019t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014er\u2014not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\u2019. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\u2019 get yer letters to yeh an\u2019 stuff\u2014one o\u2019 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you supposed to do magic?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, well\u2014I was at Hogwarts meself but I\u2014er\u2014got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\u2019 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and we\u2019ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\u201d said Hagrid loudly. \u201cGotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\u2019 that.\u201d\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou can kip under that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\u2019 dormice in one o\u2019 the pockets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. DIAGON ALLEY\n\n\n\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he told himself firmly. \u201cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard.\u201d\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s an owl\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPay him,\u201d Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets\u2014bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags\u2026 finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.\n\n\u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n\u201cKnuts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n\u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\n\n\u201cUm\u2014Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any money\u2014and you heard Uncle Vernon last night\u2026 he won\u2019t pay for me to go and learn magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \u201cD\u2019yeh think yer parents didn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if their house was destroyed\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a sausage, they\u2019re not bad cold\u2014an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no teh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cWizards have banks?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n\u201cGoblins?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe\u2014\u2019cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\u2019 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\u201d Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \u201cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\u2019 you gettin\u2019 things from Gringotts\u2014knows he can trust me, see.\n\n\u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n\n\u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cFlew?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter use magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\n\u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter\u2014er\u2014speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\n\u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cSpells\u2014enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way\u2014Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die of hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\u201d\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life.\n\n\u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u201d\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \u201cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \u201cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so they say,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCrikey, I\u2019d like a dragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted one ever since I was a kid\u2014here we go.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t understand \u201cMuggle money,\u201d as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\n\n\u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s a list there of everything yeh need.\u201d\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t noticed the night before, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\nFirst year students will require:\n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\n\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\n\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\n\n4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)\n\nPlease note that all pupils\u2019 clothes should carry name tags\n\nCOURSE BOOKS\n\nAll students should have a copy of each of the following:\n\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\n\nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\n\nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\n\nA Beginners\u2019 Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch\n\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\n\nMagical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander\n\nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self Protection by Quentin Trimble\n\nOTHER EQUIPMENT\n\n1 wand\n\n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set\n\n1 set of glass or crystal phials\n\n1 telescope set\n\n1 brass scales\n\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\n\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS\n\n\n\n\u201cCan we buy all this in London?\u201d Harry wondered aloud.\n\n\u201cIf yeh know where to go,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual, Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees buckle.\n\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis this\u2014can this be ?\u201d\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n\u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry Potter\u2026 what an honor.\u201d\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n\u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand\u2014I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\u201d Harry shook hands again and again\u2014Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\n\u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\u201d He looked terrified at the very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\n\u201cMust get on\u2014lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n\u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh\u2014mind you, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience\u2026 They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag\u2014never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\n\u201cThree up\u2026 two across,\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight, stand back, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered\u2014it wriggled\u2014in the middle, a small hole appeared\u2014it grew wider and wider\u2014a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\nHe grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons\u2014All Sizes\u2014Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver\u2014Self Stirring\u2014Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we gotta get yer money first.\u201d\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u201cDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad\u2026\u201d\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium\u2014Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of them say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand\u2014fastest ever\u2014\u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon\u2026\n\n\u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was\u2014\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\n\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\n\n\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours,\n\nThief, you have been warned, beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike I said, Yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More \u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in\u2014Hagrid with some difficulty\u2014and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late\u2014they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d\n\n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry\u2019s\u2014it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n\n\u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said Griphook.\n\n\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least\u2014but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life\u2014more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n\n\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here\u2014another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n\u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n\n\u201cI do\u2014Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been\u2014imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n\n\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\n\n\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage\u2014lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the drawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know\u2014not knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s.\n\n\u201c\u2014and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were\u2014he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\u2019 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in \u2019em in a long line o\u2019 Muggles\u2014look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like\u2014like soccer in the Muggle world\u2014everyone follows Quidditch\u2014played up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls\u2014sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\n\u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d\n\n\u201cVol\u2014sorry\u2014You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\n\n\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of the curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d\n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again.\n\n\u201cJust yer wand left\u2014A yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birthday present.\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at\u2014an\u2019 I don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander\u2019s left now\u2014only place fer wands, Ollivander\u2019s, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d\n\nA magic wand\u2026 this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it\u2014it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands\u2026 well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do\u2026\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again\u2026 Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now\u2014Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014well, I\u2019m right handed,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n\n\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried\u2014but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n\n\u201cNo, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere\u2014I wonder, now\u2014yes, why not\u2014unusual combination\u2014holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well\u2026 how curious\u2026 how very curious\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious\u2026 curious\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather\u2014just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it\u2019s brother\u2014why, it\u2019s brother gave you that scar.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n\u201cYes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember\u2026 I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter\u2026 After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things\u2014terrible, yes, but great.\u201d\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birthday of his life\u2014and yet\u2014he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander\u2026 but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol\u2014sorry\u2014I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d\n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts\u2014I did\u2014still do, \u2019smatter of fact.\u201d\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\n\n\u201cYer ticket fer Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst o\u2019 September\u2014King\u2019s Cross\u2014it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll know where to find me\u2026 See yeh soon, Harry.\u201d\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him\u2014in fact, they didn\u2019t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Uncle Vernon?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to\u2014to go to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n\u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u201d\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\n\u201cFunny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cWhere is this school, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\u2019clock,\u201d he read.\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\n\u201cPlatform what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on my ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201chowling mad, the lot of them. You\u2019ll see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take you to King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\n\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle Vernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\u201d\n\nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes\u2014he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine\u2014platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do they?\u201d\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\n\n\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2014packed with Muggles, of course\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\u2019s in front of him\u2014and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s the platform number?\u201d said the boys\u2019 mother.\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters!\u201d piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, \u201cMom, can\u2019t I go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\u201d\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it\u2014but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n\u201cFred, you next,\u201d the plump woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u201d said the boy. \u201cHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m George?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, George, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, I am Fred,\u201d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone\u2014but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there\u2014and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\u2019t anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s new, too.\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe thing is\u2014the thing is, I don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to get onto the platform?\u201d she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\u2019d be in trouble\u2014leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run\u2014the barrier was coming nearer and nearer\u2014he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop\u2014the cart was out of control\u2014he was a foot away\u2014he closed his eyes ready for the crash\u2014\n\nIt didn\u2019t come\u2026 he kept on running\u2026 he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o\u2019clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-quarters on it. He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying, \u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Neville,\u201d he heard the old woman sigh.\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\n\u201cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\u201d\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\n\u201cWant a hand?\u201d It was one of the red haired twins he\u2019d followed through the barrier.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry panted.\n\n\u201cOy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u201d\n\nWith the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\u2019s lightning scar.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said the first twin. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he added to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d chorused the twins.\n\n\u201cOh, him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, yes, I am.\u201d\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\u2019s open door.\n\n\u201cFred? George? Are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing, Mom.\u201d\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n\u201cRon, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u201d\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n\u201cMom\u2014geroff\u2014\u201d He wriggled free.\n\n\u201cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Percy?\u201d said their mother.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\u201d said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \u201cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cOnce\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr twice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA minute\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll summer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Percy the Prefect.\n\n\u201cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a prefect,\u201d said their mother fondly. \u201cAll right, dear, well, have a good term\u2014send me an owl when you get there.\u201d\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n\n\u201cNow, you two\u2014this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve blown up a toilet or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. And look after Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n\n\u201cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\u201d\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him looking.\n\n\u201cYou know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the little girl\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\u2019t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\u2019s really there\u2014like lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor dear\u2014no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\u201d\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n\u201cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, keep your hair on.\u201d\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, Mom.\u201d\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\n\n\u201cAnyone sitting there?\u201d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \u201cEverywhere else is full.\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\n\n\u201cHey, Ron.\u201d\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re going down the middle of the train\u2014Lee Jordan\u2019s got a giant tarantula down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d mumbled Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said the other twin, \u201cdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\n\n\u201cAre you really Harry Potter?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\u2019s jokes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd have you really got\u2014you know\u2026\u201d\n\nHe pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where You-Know-Who\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\n\u201cAre all your family wizards?\u201d asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Yes, I think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think Mom\u2019s got a second cousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you must know loads of magic already.\u201d\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\n\u201cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat are they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible\u2014well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\u2019d had three wizard brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \u201cI\u2019m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\u2019ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left\u2014Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\u2019re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand, and Percy\u2019s old rat.\u201d\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Scabbers and he\u2019s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\u2019t aff\u2014I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\u2019s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\n\u201c\u2026and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\u2014\u201d\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou said You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u201d said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you, of all people\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI just never knew you shouldn\u2019t. See what I mean? I\u2019ve got loads to learn\u2026 I bet,\u201d he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \u201cI bet I\u2019m the worst in the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be. There\u2019s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\u201d\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \u201cAnything off the cart, dears?\u201d\n\nHarry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\u2019s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\u2019d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry\u2014but the woman didn\u2019t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\n\n\u201cHungry, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStarving,\u201d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \u201cShe always forgets I don\u2019t like corned beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwap you for one of these,\u201d said Harry, holding up a pasty. \u201cGo on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, it\u2019s all dry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t got much time,\u201d he added quickly, \u201cyou know, with five of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, have a pasty,\u201d said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\u2019s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \u201cThey\u2019re not really frogs, are they?\u201d He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut see what the card is. I\u2019m missing Agrippa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course, you wouldn\u2019t know\u2014Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect\u2014famous witches and wizards. I\u2019ve got about five hundred, but I haven\u2019t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\u201d\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\u2019s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSo this is Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d never heard of Dumbledore!\u201d said Ron. \u201cCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa\u2014thanks\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\n\n\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\u2019s face had disappeared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again and I\u2019ve got about six of her\u2026 do you want it? You can start collecting.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u201d Ron sounded amazed. \u201cWeird!\u201d\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\u201cYou want to be careful with those,\u201d Ron warned Harry. \u201cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor\u2014you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\u201d\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n\n\u201cBleaaargh\u2014see? Sprouts.\u201d\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you seen a toad at all?\u201d\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \u201cI\u2019ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll turn up,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy miserably. \u201cWell, if you see him\u2026\u201d\n\nHe left.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf I\u2019d brought a toad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cHe might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference,\u201d said Ron in disgust. \u201cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, look\u2026\u201d\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n\n\u201cUnicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway\u2014\u201d\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\u2019s lost one,\u201d she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already told him we haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Ron, but the girl wasn\u2019t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\n\u201cOh, are you doing magic? Let\u2019s see it, then.\u201d\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014all right.\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\u2019s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\u2019s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\u2019ve heard\u2014I\u2019ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough\u2014I\u2019m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\u201d\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\u2019t learned all the course books by heart either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ron Weasley,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAre you really?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI know all about you, of course\u2014I got a few extra books for background reading, and you\u2019re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n\u201cGoodness, didn\u2019t you know, I\u2019d have found out everything I could if it was me,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDo either of you know what house you\u2019ll be in? I\u2019ve been asking around, and I hope I\u2019m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u2026 Anyway, we\u2019d better go and look for Neville\u2019s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n\u201cWhatever house I\u2019m in, I hope she\u2019s not in it,\u201d said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \u201cStupid spell\u2014George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat house are your brothers in?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cGryffindor,\u201d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \u201cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll say if I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the house Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\u2019 whiskers are a bit lighter,\u201d said Harry, trying to take Ron\u2019s mind off houses. \u201cSo what do your oldest brothers do now that they\u2019ve left, anyway?\u201d\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\u2019d finished school.\n\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\u2019s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDid you hear about Gringotts? It\u2019s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\u2019t suppose you get that with the Muggles\u2014someone tried to rob a high security vault.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cReally? What happened to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such big news. They haven\u2019t been caught. My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\u2019t think they took anything, that\u2019s what\u2019s odd. \u2019Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u201d\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \u201cVoldemort\u201d without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite Quidditch team?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I don\u2019t know any,\u201d Harry confessed.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Ron looked dumbfounded. \u201cOh, you wait, it\u2019s the best game in the world\u2014\u201d And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\u2019d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\u2019d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\u2019t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\u2019d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\u2019s in this compartment. So it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\n\n\u201cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u201d said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \u201cAnd my name\u2019s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n\n\u201cThink my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\u201d\n\nHe turned back to Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry didn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\u201d he said coolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn\u2019t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\u2019t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\u2019ll rub off on you.\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to fight us, are you?\u201d Malfoy sneered.\n\n\u201cUnless you get out now,\u201d said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\u2019ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\u201d\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron\u2014Ron leapt forward, but before he\u2019d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\u2019s knuckle\u2014Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\u2019d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n\n\u201cWhat has been going on?\u201d she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u201d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t believe it\u2014he\u2019s gone back to sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met Malfoy before?\u201d\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of his family,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\u2019d been bewitched. My dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He says Malfoy\u2019s father didn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\u201d He turned to Hermione. \u201cCan we help you with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\u2019re nearly there. You haven\u2019t been fighting, have you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we even get there!\u201d\n\n\u201cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\u201d said Ron, scowling at her. \u201cWould you mind leaving while we change?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\u201d said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\u201d\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: \u201cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \u201cFirs\u2019 years! Firs\u2019 years over here! All right there, Harry?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, follow me\u2014any more firs\u2019 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\u2019 years follow me!\u201d\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019 all get yer firs\u2019 sight o\u2019 Hogwarts in a sec,\u201d Hagrid called over his shoulder, \u201cjus\u2019 round this bend here.\u201d\n\nThere was a loud \u201cOooooh!\u201d\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n\u201cNo more\u2019n four to a boat!\u201d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.\n\n\u201cEveryone in?\u201d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \u201cRight then\u2014FORWARD!\u201d\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n\u201cHeads down!\u201d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n\n\u201cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\u201d said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\n\n\u201cTrevor!\u201d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.\n\n\u201cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\u201d\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. THE SORTING HAT\n\n\n\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\u2019s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\n\n\u201cThe firs\u2019 years, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\u2019 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here\u2014but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Hogwarts,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThe start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n\n\u201cThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\n\u201cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\u201d\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\u2019s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\u2019s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n\n\u201cI shall return when we are ready for you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cPlease wait quietly.\u201d\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\u201cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\u201d he asked Ron.\n\n\u201cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet\u2014what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\u2019t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\u2019d learned and wondering which one she\u2019d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\u2019d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his teacher\u2019s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air\u2014several people behind him screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\u2019s not really even a ghost\u2014I say, what are you all doing here?\u201d\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\u201cNew students!\u201d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \u201cAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?\u201d\n\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\n\u201cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\u201d said the Friar. \u201cMy old house, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove along now,\u201d said a sharp voice. \u201cThe Sorting Ceremony\u2019s about to start.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \u201cand follow me.\u201d\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the heavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in the house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing\u2014noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth\u2014and the hat began to sing:\n\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty,\n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see,\n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\n\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\n\nSet Gryffindors apart;\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\n\nAnd unafraid of toil;\n\n\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nIf you\u2019ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\n\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYou\u2019ll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\n\n\nSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid!\n\nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap!\n\nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u201d Ron whispered to Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott, Hannah!\u201d\n\nA pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause\u2014\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat.\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\n\n\u201cBones, Susan!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n\n\u201cBoot, Terry!\u201d\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n\n\u201cBrocklehurst, Mandy\u201d went to Ravenclaw too, but \u201cBrown, Lavender\u201d became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\u2019s twin brothers catcalling.\n\n\u201cBulstrode, Millicent\u201d then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\u2019s imagination, after all he\u2019d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n\n\u201cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \u201cFinnigan, Seamus,\u201d the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cGranger, Hermione!\u201d\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n\n\u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\u2019re very nervous. What if he wasn\u2019t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\u2019d better get back on the train?\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR,\u201d Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \u201cMacDougal, Morag.\u201d\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many people left now. \u201cMoon\u201d\u2026, \u201cNott\u201d\u2026, \u201cParkinson\u201d\u2026, then a pair of twin girls, \u201cPatil\u201d and \u201cPatil\u201d\u2026, then \u201cPerks, Sally Anne\u201d\u2026, and then, at last\u2014\n\n\u201cPotter, Harry!\u201d\n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n\n\u201cPotter, did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said a small voice in his ear. \u201cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\u2019s talent, ah my goodness, yes\u2014and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s interesting\u2026 So where shall I put you?\u201d\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n\n\u201cNot Slytherin, eh?\u201d said the small voice. \u201cAre you sure? You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that\u2014no? Well, if you\u2019re sure\u2014better be GRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \u201cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\u201d Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water.\n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ron, excellent,\u201d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \u201cZabini, Blaise,\u201d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not.\n\n\u201cIs he\u2014a bit mad?\u201d he asked Percy uncertainly.\n\n\u201cMad?\u201d said Percy airily. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n\n\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \u201cCan\u2019t you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who you are!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cMy brothers told me about you\u2014you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy\u2014\u201d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\n\n\u201cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u201d\n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t going at all the way he wanted.\n\n\u201cLike this,\u201d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \u201cSo\u2014new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s becoming almost unbearable\u2014he\u2019s the Slytherin ghost.\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cHow did he get covered in blood?\u201d asked Seamus with great interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding\u2014\u201d\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m half-and-half,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cMe dad\u2019s a Muggle. Mom didn\u2019t tell him she was a witch \u2019til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\u201d\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Neville?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u201d said Neville, \u201cbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me\u2014he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned\u2014but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced\u2014all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here\u2014they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\u201d\n\nOn Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\u201cI do hope they start right away, there\u2019s so much to learn, I\u2019m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\u2019s supposed to be very difficult\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing\u2014\u201d).\n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s eyes\u2014and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Percy.\n\n\u201cN-nothing.\u201d\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\u2019s look\u2014a feeling that he didn\u2019t like Harry at all.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u201d he asked Percy.\n\n\u201cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\u2019s looking so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\u2019t want to\u2014everyone knows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\u201d\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\u2019t look at him again.\n\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\n\u201cAhem\u2014just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notices to give you.\n\n\u201cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\n\u201cI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\n\u201cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\u201d\n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not serious?\u201d he muttered to Percy.\n\n\u201cMust be,\u201d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re not allowed to go somewhere\u2014the forest\u2019s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\u201d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\u2019 smiles had become rather fixed.\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\n\u201cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand off we go!\u201d\n\nAnd the school bellowed:\n\nHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\n\nTeach us something please,\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees,\n\n\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff,\n\nFor now they\u2019re bare and full of air,\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\n\n\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\n\nBring back what we\u2019ve forgot,\n\nJust do your best, we\u2019ll do the rest,\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\n\u201cAh, music,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\u2019s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d Percy whispered to the first years. \u201cA poltergeist.\u201d He raised his voice, \u201cPeeves\u2014show yourself!\u201d\n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\u201d\n\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n\n\u201cOooooooh!\u201d he said, with an evil cackle. \u201cIckle Firsties! What fun!\u201d\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\n\u201cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I mean it!\u201d barked Percy.\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\n\u201cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\u201d said Percy, as they set off again. \u201cThe Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one who can control him, he won\u2019t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\u201d\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCaput Draconis,\u201d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it\u2014Neville needed a leg up\u2014and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase\u2014they were obviously in one of the towers\u2014they found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\n\u201cGreat food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \u201cGet off, Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my sheets.\u201d\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\u2019s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully\u2014and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it\u2014then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold\u2014there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. THE POTIONS MASTER\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere, look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWearing the glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his scar?\u201d\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\n\nThere were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u2019t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\n\nThe ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \u201cGOT YOUR CONK!\u201d\n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\u2019s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u2019d whisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u2019s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\u201cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\u2019t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\u2019t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u2019t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have much of a head start.\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got today?\u201d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\n\n\u201cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape\u2019s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them\u2014we\u2019ll be able to see if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish McGonagall favored us,\u201d said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\u2019t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\n\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. Snape didn\u2019t dislike Harry\u2014he hated him.\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAh, Yes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new\u2014celebrity.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had none of Hagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\u2014like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\u2026 I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death\u2014if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d\n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\u2019t a dunderhead.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot into the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSnape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\u201cTut, tut\u2014fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\nHe ignored Hermione\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201d\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\u201d Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\u201d\n\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione does, though, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d\n\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \u201cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \u201cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\u201d\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\n\n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014Potter\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\u201d\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u2019d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week\u2014why did Snape hate him so much?\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Ron, \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\u201d\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u2019s voice rang out, saying, \u201cBack, Fang\u2014back.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d he said. \u201cBack, Fang.\u201d\n\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\n\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\n\u201cMake yerselves at home,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\n\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s freckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\u201d\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u2019s knee and drooled all over his robes.\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \u201cthat old git.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get rid of her\u2014Fitch puts her up to it.\u201d\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\n\u201cBut he seemed to really hate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhy should he?\u201d\n\nYet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u201d Hagrid asked Ron. \u201cI liked him a lot\u2014great with animals.\u201d\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\n\n\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t mentioned the date.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It might\u2019ve been happening while we were there!\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t meet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u2019d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u2019t want to tell Harry?\n\n\n\n\n\n9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\n\n\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u2019t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday\u2014and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\u201d\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cAnyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u2019s all talk.\u201d\n\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of a book\u2014not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\u2019s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Remembrall!\u201d he explained. \u201cGran knows I forget things\u2014this tells you if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red\u2014oh\u2026\u201d His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u201c\u2026you\u2019ve forgotten something\u2026\u201d\n\nNeville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got my Remembrall, Professor.\u201d\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\n\u201cJust looking,\u201d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\n\nAt three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked. \u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\n\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom,\u201d called Madam Hooch at the front, \u201cand say \u2018Up!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUP!\u201d everyone shouted.\n\nHarry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u2019d been doing it wrong for years.\n\n\u201cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle\u2014three\u2014two\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\u2019s lips.\n\n\u201cCome back, boy!\u201d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle\u2014twelve feet\u2014twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and\u2014\n\nWHAM\u2014a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n\n\u201cBroken wrist,\u201d Harry heard her mutter. \u201cCome on, boy\u2014it\u2019s all right, up you get.\u201d\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\n\u201cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\u2019ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \u2018Quidditch.\u2019 Come on, dear.\u201d\n\nNeville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n\n\u201cDid you see his face, the great lump?\u201d\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d snapped Parvati Patil.\n\n\u201cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\u201d said Pansy Parkinson, a hard faced Slytherin girl. \u201cNever thought you\u2019d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid thing Longbottom\u2019s gran sent him.\u201d\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\n\u201cGive that here, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find\u2014how about\u2014up a tree?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it here!\u201d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\u2019t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \u201cCome and get it, Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Hermione Granger. \u201cMadam Hooch told us not to move\u2014you\u2019ll get us all into trouble.\u201d\n\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\u2019d found something he could do without being taught\u2014this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d Harry called, \u201cor I\u2019ll knock you off that broom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\n\u201cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\u201d Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\u201cCatch it if you can, then!\u201d he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\u2014next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\u2014wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching\u2014he stretched out his hand\u2014a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\n\u201cHARRY POTTER!\u201d\n\nHis heart sank faster than he\u2019d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\n\u201cNever\u2014in all my time at Hogwarts\u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \u201c\u2014how dare you\u2014might have broken your neck\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault, Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Miss Patil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Malfoy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\u201d\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u2019s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\u2019s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted two weeks. He\u2019d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\u201d\n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who came out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking confused.\n\n\u201cFollow me, you two,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n\n\u201cIn here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n\n\u201cOut, Peeves!\u201d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n\n\u201cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood\u2014I\u2019ve found you a Seeker.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n\n\u201cAre you serious, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cThe boy\u2019s a natural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\n\n\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,\u201d Professor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n\n\u201cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\u201d he asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cWood\u2019s captain of the Gryffindor team,\u201d Professor McGonagall explained.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the build for a Seeker, too,\u201d said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \u201cLight\u2014speedy\u2014we\u2019ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor\u2014a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u2019t bend the first year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks\u2026\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n\n\u201cI want to hear you\u2019re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\u201d\n\nThen she suddenly smiled.\n\n\u201cYour father would have been proud,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all about it.\n\n\u201cSeeker?\u201d he said. \u201cBut first years never\u2014you must be the youngest house player in about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014a century,\u201d said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \u201cWood told me.\u201d\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n\n\u201cI start training next week,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnly don\u2019t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said George in a low voice. \u201cWood told us. We\u2019re on the team too\u2014Beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, we\u2019re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won since Charlie left, but this year\u2019s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u2019s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet it\u2019s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\u201d\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot braver now that you\u2019re back on the ground and you\u2019ve got your little friends with you,\u201d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take you on anytime on my own,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cTonight, if you want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only\u2014no contact. What\u2019s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Ron, wheeling around. \u201cI\u2019m his second, who\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n\n\u201cCrabbe,\u201d he said. \u201cMidnight all right? We\u2019ll meet you in the trophy room; that\u2019s always unlocked.\u201d\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \u201cWhat is a wizard\u2019s duel?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd what do you mean, you\u2019re my second?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u201d said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u2019s face, he added quickly, \u201cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\u201d Ron suggested.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t a person eat in peace in this place?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you could,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201c\u2014and you mustn\u2019t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if you\u2019re caught, and you\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very selfish of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Ron.\n\nAll the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u2019t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \u201cIf he tries to curse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t remember how to block them.\u201d There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness\u2014this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face to face. He couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\n\u201cHalf past eleven,\u201d Ron muttered at last, \u201cwe\u2019d better go.\u201d\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to do this, Harry.\u201d\n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cGo back to bed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost told your brother,\u201d Hermione snapped, \u201cPercy\u2014he\u2019s a prefect, he\u2019d put a stop to this.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n\nHermione wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\u2019t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\u2019ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\u2019re on the train home tomorrow, you\u2019re so\u2014\u201d\n\nBut what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\n\n\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d she asked shrilly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\nThey hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\u2019ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve\u2014\u201d said Ron loudly.\n\n\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cI heard something.\u201d\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n\n\u201cMrs. Norris?\u201d breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n\n\u201cThank goodness you found me! I\u2019ve been out here for hours, I couldn\u2019t remember the new password to get in to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\u2019s \u2018Pig snout\u2019 but it won\u2019t help you now, the Fat Lady\u2019s gone off somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Neville, showing them. \u201cMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u2014well, look, Neville, we\u2019ve got to be somewhere, we\u2019ll see you later\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u2019s been past twice already.\u201d\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\n\n\u201cIf either of you get us caught, I\u2019ll never rest until I\u2019ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\u201d\n\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn\u2019t Malfoy.\n\n\u201cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\u201d\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\u2019s voice. Neville\u2019s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in here somewhere,\u201d they heard him mutter, \u201cprobably hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following\u2014they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going\u2014they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n\n\u201cI\u2014told\u2014you,\u201d Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \u201cI\u2014told\u2014you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\u201d said Ron, \u201cquickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy tricked you,\u201d Hermione said to Harry. \u201cYou realize that, don\u2019t you? He was never going to meet you\u2014Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\u201d\n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. They hadn\u2019t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n\n\u201cShut up, Peeves\u2014please\u2014you\u2019ll get us thrown out.\u201d\n\nPeeves cackled.\n\n\u201cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\u2019ll get caughty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t give us away, Peeves, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould tell Filch, I should,\u201d said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\n\n\u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\u201d Peeves bellowed, \u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\u2014\u201d\n\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door\u2014and it was locked.\n\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \u201cWe\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u201d They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\u2019s shouts.\n\n\u201cOh, move over,\u201d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u2019s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \u201cAlohomora!\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open\u2014they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\n\u201cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\u201d Filch was saying. \u201cQuick, tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cShan\u2019t say nothing if you don\u2019t say please,\u201d said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing if you didn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u201d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\n\u201cHe thinks this door is locked,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay\u2014get off, Neville!\u201d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u2019s bathrobe for the last minute. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry turned around\u2014and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\u2019d walked into a nightmare\u2014this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\n\nThey weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob\u2014between Filch and death, he\u2019d take Filch.\n\nThey fell backward\u2014Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\u2019t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared\u2014all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\n\u201cWhere on earth have you all been?\u201d she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\n\u201cNever mind that\u2014pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\u2019d never speak again.\n\n\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\u201d\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \u201cYou don\u2019t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\u201d she snapped. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what it was standing on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe floor?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s obviously guarding something.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\u2014or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think we dragged her along, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something\u2026 What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide\u2014except perhaps Hogwarts.\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. HALLOWEEN\n\n\n\n\nMalfoy couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOr both,\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\u2019t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a broomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\u2019clock for your first training session.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\u201d Ron moaned enviously. \u201cI\u2019ve never even touched one.\u201d\n\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t resist it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry. \u201cComets look flashy, but they\u2019re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u2019t afford half the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back. \u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked.\n\n\u201cPotter\u2019s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said Malfoy quickly.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u201d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u201d he added.\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t stolen Neville\u2019s Remembrall I wouln\u2019t be on the team\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking rules?\u201d came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t stop now,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019s doing us so much good.\u201d\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\u2019s bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n\nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\u2019d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling\u2014he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\n\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what McGonagall meant\u2026 you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team practice three times a week.\u201d\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo\u2014that\u2019s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called the Keeper. I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air\u2014it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \u201cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u2019s why you have two Beaters on each team\u2014the Weasley twins are ours\u2014it\u2019s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So\u2014think you\u2019ve got all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\u201d Harry reeled off.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u201d Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\n\n\u201cNever at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014unless they crack my head open.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers\u2014I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\u201d\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the most important ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch because it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\u2014I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it\u2014any questions?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t practice with the Snitch yet,\u201d said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \u201cit\u2019s too dark, we might lose it. Let\u2019s try you out with a few of these.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u2019t carry on.\n\n\u201cThat Quidditch cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u201d said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing dragons.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\u2019d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\u2019s broomstick had arrived.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve been practicing!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too\u2014never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f\u2019 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\u201d\n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it\u2014Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n\nRon, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more luck.\n\n\u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it wrong,\u201d Harry heard Hermione snap. \u201cIt\u2019s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \u2018gar\u2019 nice and long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u201d Ron snarled.\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\n\n\u201cOh, well done!\u201d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \u201cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u201d\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u201d he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \u201cshe\u2019s a nightmare, honestly.\u201d\n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face\u2014and was startled to see that she was in tears.\n\n\u201cI think she heard you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \u201cShe must\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u201d\n\nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u2019 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u2019s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \u201cTroll\u2014in the dungeons\u2014thought you ought to know.\u201d\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence.\n\n\u201cPrefects,\u201d he rumbled, \u201clead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\u201d\n\nPercy was in his element.\n\n\u201cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could a troll get in?\u201d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\u201d\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought\u2014Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u201d\n\nRon bit his lip.\n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut Percy\u2019d better not see us.\u201d\n\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\u2019 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch me.\u201d\n\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\u2019s fading footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u201d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n\n\u201cCan you smell something?\u201d\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n\nAnd then they heard it\u2014a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed\u2014at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n\n\u201cThe keys in the lock,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could lock it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop\u2014a high, petrified scream\u2014and it was coming from the chamber they\u2019d just chained up.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d they said together.\n\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\n\n\u201cConfuse it!\u201d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n\n\u201cOy, pea brain!\u201d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u2019t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n\n\u201cCome on, run, run!\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\u2019s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his hand when he\u2019d jumped\u2014it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s nostrils.\n\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\u2014not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over\u2014and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\n\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\n\n\u201cIs it\u2014dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think it\u2019s just been knocked out.\u201d\n\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n\n\u201cUrgh\u2014troll boogers.\u201d\n\nHe wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers.\n\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\u2019t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u201d\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cPlease, Professor McGonagall\u2014they were looking for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n\n\u201cI went looking for the troll because I\u2014I thought I could deal with it on my own\u2014you know, because I\u2019ve read all about them.\u201d\n\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u2019t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u2019t new to them.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014in that case\u2026\u201d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \u201cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\u201d\n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you. If you\u2019re not hurt at all, you\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\u201d\n\nHermione left.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\u201d\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\n\n\u201cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\u201d Ron grumbled.\n\n\u201cFive, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u201d Ron admitted. \u201cMind you, we did save her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t locked the thing in with her,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n\n\u201cPig snout,\u201d they said and entered.\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d and hurried off to get plates.\n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n11. QUIDDITCH\n\n\n\n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\u2019t know which was worse\u2014people telling him he\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\n\n\u201cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,\u201d said Snape. \u201cGive it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just made that rule up,\u201d Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \u201cWonder what\u2019s wrong with his leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u201d said Ron bitterly.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\u2019s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\u201cHow will you learn?\u201d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.\n\n\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside\u2014and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\n\n\u201cBlasted thing,\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but\u2014\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\n\n\u201cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGET OUT! OUT!\u201d\n\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\n\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Ron asked as Harry joined them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\u2019d seen.\n\n\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d he finished breathlessly. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was going when we saw him\u2014he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! And I\u2019d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were wide.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not very nice, but he wouldn\u2019t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cI\u2019m with Harry. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past Snape. But what\u2019s he after? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u201d\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He tried to empty his mind\u2014he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours\u2014but the expression on Snape\u2019s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\u2019t easy to forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat some breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a bit of toast,\u201d wheedled Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\u2019s time he\u2019d be walking onto the field.\n\n\u201cHarry, you need your strength,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan. \u201cSeekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Seamus,\u201d said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.\n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\u201cOkay, men,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d Wood agreed. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big one,\u201d said Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cThe one we\u2019ve all been waiting for,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWe know Oliver\u2019s speech by heart,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cwe were on the team last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you two,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis is the best team Gryffindor\u2019s had in years. We\u2019re going to win. I know it.\u201d\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \u201cOr else.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. It\u2019s time. Good luck, all of you.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\u2019t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\n\n\u201cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\u201d she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\n\n\u201cMount your brooms, please.\u201d\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\n\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\n\n\u201cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor\u2014what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Professor.\u201d\n\nThe Weasley twins\u2019 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\u2019s, last year only a reserve\u2014back to Johnson and\u2014no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes\u2014Flint flying like an eagle up there\u2014he\u2019s going to sc\u2014no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle\u2014that\u2019s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and\u2014OUCH\u2014that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger\u2014Quaffle taken by the Slytherins\u2014that\u2019s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\u2019s blocked by a second Bludger\u2014sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\u2019t tell which\u2014nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes\u2014she\u2019s really flying\u2014dodges a speeding Bludger\u2014the goal posts are ahead\u2014come on, now, Angelina\u2014Keeper Bletchley dives\u2014misses\u2014GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\n\n\u201cBudge up there, move along.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\n\n\u201cBin watchin\u2019 from me hut,\u201d said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the same as bein\u2019 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had much to do yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKept outta trouble, though, that\u2019s somethin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\n\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\u2019s game plan.\n\n\u201cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\u201d Wood had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you attacked before you have to be.\u201d\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\u2019 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession,\u201d Lee Jordan was saying, \u201cChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the\u2014wait a moment\u2014was that the Snitch?\u201d\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs\u2014he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead\u2014he put on an extra spurt of speed\u2014\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below\u2014Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\u2019s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \u201cSend him off, ref! Red card!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cRed card!\u201d said Dean furiously. \u201cIn soccer you get shown the red card and you\u2019re out of the game!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t soccer, Dean,\u201d Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\u201d\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan!\u201d growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cI mean, after that open and revolting foul\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan, I\u2019m warning you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u201d\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts\u2014he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out\u2014and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession\u2014Flint with the Quaffle\u2014passes Spinnet\u2014passes Bell\u2014hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\u2014only joking, Professor\u2014Slytherins score\u2014A no\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\u201cDunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \u201cIf I didn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d lost control of his broom\u2026 but he can\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\u2019s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\n\n\u201cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\u201d Seamus whispered.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have,\u201d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \u201cCan\u2019t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic\u2014no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\u201d\n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\u2019s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d moaned Ron, gray faced.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Hermione gasped, \u201cSnape\u2014look.\u201d\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing something\u2014jinxing the broom,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good\u2014every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately.\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\u2019s robes.\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row\u2014Snape would never know what had happened.\n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\n\n\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes.\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick\u2014he hit the field on all fours\u2014coughed\u2014and something gold fell into his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u201d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\u201d Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference\u2014Harry hadn\u2019t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results\u2014Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt was Snape,\u201d Ron was explaining, \u201cHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \u201cWhy would Snape do somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\n\n\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d he told Hagrid. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\n\n\u201cHow do you know about Fluffy?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFluffy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014he\u2019s mine\u2014bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\u2019 year\u2014I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t ask me anymore,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cThat\u2019s top secret, that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Snape\u2019s trying to steal it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cSnape\u2019s a Hogwarts teacher, he\u2019d do nothin\u2019 of the sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why did he just try to kill Harry?\u201d cried Hermione.\n\nThe afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.\n\n\u201cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\u2019ve read all about them! You\u2019ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\u2019t blinking at all, I saw him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u201d said Hagrid hotly. \u201cI don\u2019 know why Harry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh\u2014yer meddlin\u2019 in things that don\u2019 concern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019 you forget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor Dumbledore an\u2019 Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED\n\n\n\n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\n\n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted at home.\u201d\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\u2019d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s cold drawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose\u2014that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u201d\n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d\n\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\u201d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \u201cMalfoy was insultin\u2019 his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\u2019t more. Move along, all of you.\u201d\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s back, \u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll get him\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them both,\u201d said Harry, \u201cMalfoy and Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cTell yeh what, come with me an\u2019 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\u201d\n\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\n\n\u201cAh, Hagrid, the last tree\u2014put it in the far corner, would you?\u201d\n\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\n\n\u201cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\u201d Hagrid asked.\n\n\u201cJust one,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd that reminds me\u2014Harry, Ron, we\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\n\n\u201cThe library?\u201d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \u201cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re not working,\u201d Harry told him brightly. \u201cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been trying to find out who he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Hagrid looked shocked. \u201cListen here\u2014I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that dog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u201d Harry added. \u201cWe must\u2019ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\u2019t find him anywhere\u2014just give us a hint\u2014I know I\u2019ve read his name somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid flatly.\n\n\u201cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\u201d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on\u2014out!\u201d\n\nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\n\n\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork\u2014bread, English muffins, marshmallows\u2014and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family\u2014in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \u201cDon\u2019t send me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWill you look at this? I\u2019ve got some presents!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect, turnips?\u201d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s.\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it\u2014it sounded a bit like an owl.\n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.\n\n\n\nTaped to the note was a fifty pence piece.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s friendly,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n\n\u201cWeird!\u201d he said, \u201cWhat a shape! This is money?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \u201cHagrid and my aunt and uncle\u2014so who sent these?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u201d said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \u201cMy mom. I told her you didn\u2019t expect any presents and\u2014oh, no,\u201d he groaned, \u201cshe\u2019s made you a Weasley sweater.\u201d\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n\n\u201cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\u201d said Ron, unwrapping his own, \u201cand mine\u2019s always maroon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of her,\u201d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.\n\nHis next present also contained candy\u2014a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\n\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\u2019d gotten from Hermione. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is\u2014they\u2019re really rare, and really valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is\u2014try it on.\u201d\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n\n\u201cIt is! Look down!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a note!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cA note fell out of it!\u201d\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n\nYour father left this in my possession before he died.\n\nIt is time it was returned to you.\n\nUse it well.\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\n\n\n\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give anything for one of these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, look\u2014Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred, holding up Harry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re not family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George demanded. \u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u201d George observed. \u201cI suppose she thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid\u2014we know we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise.\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n\n\u201cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t\u2014want,\u201d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\u201d said George. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d\n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce\u2014and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\u2019s Christmas dinner.\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much.\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge.\n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.\n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n\nHis father\u2019s\u2026 this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\n\nUse it well.\n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.\n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\u2014his father\u2019s cloak\u2014he felt that this time\u2014the first time\u2014he wanted to use it alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.\n\nThe library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence\u2014the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside\u2014stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\u2019t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\n\n\u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library Restricted Section.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \u201cThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him\u2014the cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid.\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket\u2014but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed\u2014for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder\u2014but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\u2019s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air\u2014she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes\u2014her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green\u2014exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\u2019s did.\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees\u2014Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face, whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried from the room.\n\n\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly.\n\n\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\u2019t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou look odd.\u201d\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m freezing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s forget it and go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Harry hissed. I know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here\u2014just here\u2014yes!\u201d\n\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\n\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! Look at them all\u2026 there are loads of them\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u201d\n\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\u2019t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\n\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCan you see all your family standing around you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m alone\u2014but I\u2019m different\u2014I look older\u2014and I\u2019m head boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am\u2014I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to\u2014and I\u2019m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup\u2014I\u2019m Quidditch captain, too.\u201d\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can it? All my family are dead\u2014let me have another look\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\u2019s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me\u2014\u201d\n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\u2019t realized how loudly they had been talking.\n\n\u201cQuick!\u201d\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing\u2014did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe\u2014she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\u201d\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\n\nThe snow still hadn\u2019t melted the next morning.\n\n\u201cWant to play chess, Harry?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go down and visit Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 you go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\u2019t go back tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it\u2014and anyway, you\u2019ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\u2019t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Harry, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\u2019t going to stop him.\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\u2019t meet anyone.\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\n\nExcept\u2014\n\n\u201cSo\u2014back again, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him.\n\n\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \u201cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I expect you\u2019ve realized by now what it does?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2014well\u2014it shows me my family\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\u201d\n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \u201cIt shows us what we want\u2026 whatever we want\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\n\n\u201cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\u201d\n\nHarry stood up.\n\n\u201cSir\u2014Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cOne can never have enough socks,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnother Christmas has come and gone and I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\u201d\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n\n\n\n\n\n13. NICOLAS FLAMEL\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\u2019d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\u201d said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\u201cIf Filch had caught you!\u201d), and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\u2019d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\n\n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an excuse to pick on us.\u201d\n\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\u2026\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me for a moment,\u201d said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \u201cI need to concen\u2014\u201d He caught sight of Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You look terrible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\u2019s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play,\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re ill,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cPretend to break your leg,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cReally break your leg,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u2019s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\u2019s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d said Neville shakily. \u201cI met him outside the library. He said he\u2019d been looking for someone to practice that on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Professor McGonagall!\u201d Hermione urged Neville. \u201cReport him!\u201d\n\nNeville shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want more trouble,\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s used to walking all over people, but that\u2019s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to tell me I\u2019m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s already done that,\u201d Neville choked out.\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worth twelve of Malfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\u2019t it? And where\u2019s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n\n\u201cThanks, Harry\u2026 I think I\u2019ll go to bed\u2026 D\u2019you want the card, you collect them, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n\n\u201cDumbledore again,\u201d he said, \u201cHe was the first one I ever\u2014\u201d\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found him!\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve found Flamel! I told you I\u2019d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here\u2014listen to this: \u2018Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u2019!\u201d\n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u2019t looked so excited since they\u2019d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n\n\u201cStay there!\u201d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\u2019 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\n\u201cI never thought to look in here!\u201d she whispered excitedly. \u201cI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cLight?\u201d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\u2019d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we allowed to speak yet?\u201d said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cNicolas Flamel,\u201d she whispered dramatically, \u201cis the only known maker of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone!\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t have quite the effect she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, honestly, don\u2019t you two read? Look\u2014read that, there.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\n\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).\n\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \u201cThe dog must be guarding Flamel\u2019s Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\u2019re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\u2019s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\u201cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo wonder Snape\u2019s after it! Anyone would want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no wonder we couldn\u2019t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly recent if he\u2019s six hundred and sixty five, is he?\u201d\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\u2019d do with a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone if they had one. It wasn\u2019t until Ron said he\u2019d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, all the Slytherins will think I\u2019m just too scared to face Snape. I\u2019ll show them\u2026 it\u2019ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as long as we\u2019re not wiping you off the field,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\u2019t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\u2019d found out about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone? Harry didn\u2019t see how he could\u2014yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\n\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\u2019d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker Curse. They\u2019d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s Locomotor Mortis,\u201d Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ron snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t nag.\u201d\n\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\u2019s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s out there!\u201d said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \u201cEven\u2014blimey\u2014Dumbledore\u2019s come to watch!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart did a somersault.\n\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief\u2014He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Snape look so mean,\u201d he told Hermione. \u201cLook they\u2019re off\u2014Ouch!\u201d\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cWonder how long Potter\u2019s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\n\u201cYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\u201d said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \u201cIt\u2019s people they feel sorry for. See, there\u2019s Potter, who\u2019s got no parents, then there\u2019s the Weasleys, who\u2019ve got no money\u2014you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\u2019ve got no brains.\u201d\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\u201d he stammered.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \u201cYou tell him, Neville.\u201d\n\n\u201cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\u2019d be poorer than Weasley, and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Malfoy\u2014one more word\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione suddenly, \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u2019s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\u201d said Malfoy.\n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape\u2014she didn\u2019t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches\u2014the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\n\u201cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\u2019s over! Harry\u2019s won! We\u2019ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\u201d shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d done it\u2014the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped\u2014then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\u2019s smiling face.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \u201cNice to see you haven\u2019t been brooding about that mirror\u2026 been keeping busy\u2026 excellent\u2026\u201d\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\u2019t ever remember feeling happier. He\u2019d really done something to be proud of now\u2014no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d shown Snape\u2026\n\nAnd speaking of Snape\u2026\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\u2019s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\u2019s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\u2014what was going on?\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\u2019t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\n\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\u2019t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u2019t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2026d-don\u2019t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I thought we\u2019d keep this private,\u201d said Snape, his voice icy. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, after all.\u201d\n\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\u2019s yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cB-b-but Severus, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\u201d said Snape, taking a step toward him.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\u201d\n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \u201c\u2014your little bit of hocus pocus. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cB-but I d-d-don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Snape cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another little chat soon, when you\u2019ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry, where have you been?\u201d Hermione squeaked.\n\n\u201cWe won! You won! We won!\u201d shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \u201cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He\u2019s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\u2019ll be all right\u2014talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\u2019s waiting for you in the common room, we\u2019re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that now,\u201d said Harry breathlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s find an empty room, you wait \u2019til you hear this\u2026\u201d\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\u2019t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\u2019d seen and heard.\n\n\u201cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, and Snape\u2019s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy\u2014and he said something about Quirrell\u2019s \u2018hocus pocus\u2019\u2014I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you mean the Stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\u201d said Hermione in alarm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\n\n\n14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\n\n\n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\u2019d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter.\n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\u2019t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\n\n\u201cHermione, the exams are ages away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen weeks,\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s not ages, that\u2019s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not six hundred years old,\u201d Ron reminded her. \u201cAnyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\u2019s an A.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\u2019re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me\u2026\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\u2019t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never remember this,\u201d Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\u2019d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\n\nHarry, who was looking up \u201cDittany\u201d in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\u2019t look up until he heard Ron say, \u201cHagrid! What are you doing in the library?\u201d\n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 lookin\u2019,\u201d he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \u201cAn\u2019 what\u2019re you lot up ter?\u201d He looked suddenly suspicious. \u201cYer not still lookin\u2019 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\u201d said Ron impressively. \u201cAnd we know what that dog\u2019s guarding, it\u2019s a Sorcerer\u2019s St\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \u201cDon\u2019 go shoutin\u2019 about it, what\u2019s the matter with yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\u201d said Harry, \u201cabout what\u2019s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHHHH!\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cListen\u2014come an\u2019 see me later, I\u2019m not promisin\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh anythin\u2019, mind, but don\u2019 go rabbitin\u2019 about it in here, students aren\u2019 s\u2019pposed ter know. They\u2019ll think I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you later, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid shuffled off.\n\n\u201cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see what section he was in,\u201d said Ron, who\u2019d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.\n\n\u201cDragons!\u201d he whispered. \u201cHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\u2019s Guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s against our laws,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\u2019 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\u2019s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\u2019re keeping dragons in the back garden\u2014anyway, you can\u2019t tame dragons, it\u2019s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\u2019s got off wild ones in Romania.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t wild dragons in Britain?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOf course there are,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\u2019ve spotted them, to make them forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what on earths Hagrid up to?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\u2019s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \u201cWho is it?\u201d before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014yeh wanted to ask me somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \u201cWe were wondering if you could tell us what\u2019s guarding the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone apart from Fluffy.\u201d\n\nHagrid frowned at him.\n\n\u201cO\u2019 course I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019 know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\u2019 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\u2019s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts\u2014I s\u2019ppose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\u201d said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\u2019s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \u201cWe only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 s\u2019pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 he borrowed Fluffy from me\u2026 then some o\u2019 the teachers did enchantments\u2026 Professor Sprout\u2014Professor Flitwick\u2014Professor McGonagall\u2014\u201d he ticked them off on his fingers, \u201cProfessor Quirrell\u2014an\u2019 Dumbledore himself did somethin\u2019, o\u2019 course. Hang on, I\u2019ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014yer not still on abou\u2019 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\u2019s not about ter steal it.\u201d\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything\u2014except, it seemed, Quirrell\u2019s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren\u2019t you, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry anxiously. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a soul knows except me an\u2019 Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid proudly.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d Harry muttered to the others. \u201cHagrid, can we have a window open? I\u2019m boiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \u201cThat\u2019s er\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \u201cIt must\u2019ve cost you a fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLas\u2019 night. I was down in the village havin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you going to do with it when it\u2019s hatched?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bin doin\u2019 some readin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \u201cGot this outta the library\u2014Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit\u2014it\u2019s a bit outta date, o\u2019 course, but it\u2019s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019 see here\u2014how ter recognize diff\u2019rent eggs\u2014what I got there\u2019s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\u2019re rare, them.\u201d\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n\n\u201cWonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u201d Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\u2019s hatching.\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lessons, we\u2019ll get into trouble, and that\u2019s nothing to what Hagrid\u2019s going to be in when someone finds out what he\u2019s doing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Harry whispered.\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\u2019t like the look on Malfoy\u2019s face at all.\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\u2019s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly out.\u201d He ushered them inside.\n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\u2019t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n\n\u201cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\u201d\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\u2014he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains\u2014it\u2019s a kid\u2014he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u201d\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\u2019s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\n\u201cJust let him go,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cSet him free.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHe\u2019s too little. He\u2019d die.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u201d said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \u201cHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry loudly, \u201cgive it two weeks and Norbert\u2019s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\u201d\n\nHagrid bit his lip.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I know I can\u2019t keep him forever, but I can\u2019t jus\u2019 dump him, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \u201cCharlie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m Ron, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014Charlie\u2014your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow about it, Hagrid?\u201d\n\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.\n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\n\n\u201cIt bit me!\u201d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\u201d\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hedwig!\u201d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \u201cShe\u2019ll have Charlie\u2019s answer!\u201d\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter\u2014I\u2019d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\u2019t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\u2019t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\u2019s still dark.\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\n\nLove,\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too difficult\u2014I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert\u2014and Malfoy.\n\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey\u2014would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were poisonous.\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just my hand,\u201d he whispered, \u201calthough that feels like it\u2019s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me\u2014I\u2019ve told her it was a dog, but I don\u2019t think she believes me. I shouldn\u2019t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\u201d said Hermione, but this didn\u2019t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\n\n\u201cMidnight on Saturday!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cOh no\u2014oh no\u2014I\u2019ve just remembered\u2014Charlie\u2019s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\u2019s going to know we\u2019re getting rid of Norbert.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione didn\u2019t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change the plan now,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\u2019ll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you in,\u201d he puffed. \u201cNorbert\u2019s at a tricky stage\u2014nothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n\nWhen they told him about Charlie\u2019s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\n\u201cAargh! It\u2019s all right, he only got my boot\u2014jus\u2019 playin\u2019\u2014he\u2019s only a baby, after all.\u201d\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\u2019t come quickly enough.\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn\u2019t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\u2019s hut because they\u2019d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\u2019d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got lots o\u2019 rats an\u2019 some brandy fer the journey,\u201d said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\u201d\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\n\u201cBye bye, Norbert!\u201d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \u201cMommy will never forget you!\u201d\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another\u2014even one of Harry\u2019s shortcuts didn\u2019t make the work much easier.\n\n\u201cNearly there!\u201d Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\n\u201cDetention!\u201d she shouted. \u201cAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\u2019s coming\u2014he\u2019s got a dragon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on\u2014I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\u201d\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\u2019d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got detention! I could sing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.\n\nCharlie\u2019s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\u2019d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going\u2026 going\u2026 gone.\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon\u2014Malfoy in detention\u2014what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n\n\n\n\nThings couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\u2019t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \u201cI was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\n\n\u201cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\u2019s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\u201d\n\nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville\u2014Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFour students out of bed in one night! I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions\u2014yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\u2019s very dangerous\u2014and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty?\u201d Harry gasped\u2014they would lose the lead, the lead he\u2019d won in the last Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cFifty points each,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\n\n\u201cProfessor\u2014please\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\u201d\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\u2019d done?\n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \u201cThanks, Potter, we owe you one!\u201d\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\u2019ve been here, and people still like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\u201d said Harry miserably.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014no,\u201d Ron admitted.\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t his business from now on. He\u2019d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\n\n\u201cResign?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat good\u2019ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\u2019t win at Quidditch?\u201d\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \u201cthe Seeker.\u201d\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as well known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions\u2026\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014not again, please\u2014\u201d\n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014all right\u2014\u201d he heard Quirrell sob.\n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\u2019d promised himself about not meddling.\n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step\u2014Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s done it, then!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf Quirrell\u2019s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still Fluffy, though,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cMaybe Snape\u2019s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\u201d said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \u201cI bet there\u2019s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\u201d\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\n\n\u201cGo to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got no proof!\u201d said Harry. \u201cQuirrell\u2019s too scared to back us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he doesn\u2019t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor\u2014who do you think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\u2019ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life depended on it, he\u2019s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\u2019ll think. And don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u201d\n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf we just do a bit of poking around\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly, \u201cwe\u2019ve done enough poking around.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.\n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven o\u2019clock tonight.\n\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\u2019t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\u2019d got.\n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock that night, they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\u2014and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\n\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\u2019t you, eh?\u201d he said, leering at them. \u201cOh yes\u2026 hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me\u2026 It\u2019s just a pity they let the old punishments die out\u2026 hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\u2019ve got the chains still in my office, keep \u2019em well oiled in case they\u2019re ever needed\u2026 Right, off we go, and don\u2019t think of running off, now, it\u2019ll be worse for you if you do.\u201d\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding so delighted.\n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \u201cI suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy\u2014it\u2019s into the forest you\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one piece.\u201d\n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n\u201cThe forest?\u201d he repeated, and he didn\u2019t sound quite as cool as usual. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there at night\u2014there\u2019s all sorts of things in there\u2014werewolves, I heard.\u201d\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\u2019s robe and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \u201cShould\u2019ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cAbou\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI bin waitin\u2019 fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\u201d said Filch coldly, \u201cthey\u2019re here to be punished, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yer late, is it?\u201d said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \u201cBin lecturin\u2019 them, eh? \u2019Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\u2019ve done yer bit, I\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back at dawn,\u201d said Filch, \u201cfor what\u2019s left of them,\u201d he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in that forest,\u201d he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\n\n\u201cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\u201d said Hagrid fiercely. \u201cYeh\u2019ve done wrong an\u2019 now yeh\u2019ve got ter pay fer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is servant stuff, it\u2019s not for students to do. I thought we\u2019d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014tell yer that\u2019s how it is at Hogwarts,\u201d Hagrid growled. \u201cCopyin\u2019 lines! What good\u2019s that ter anyone? Yeh\u2019ll do summat useful or yeh\u2019ll get out. If yeh think yer father\u2019d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\u2019 pack. Go on.\u201d\n\nMalfoy didn\u2019t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cnow, listen carefully, \u2019cause it\u2019s dangerous what we\u2019re gonna do tonight, an\u2019 I don\u2019 want no one takin\u2019 risks. Follow me over here a moment.\u201d\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\n\n\u201cLook there,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201csee that stuff shinin\u2019 on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\u2019s unicorn blood. There\u2019s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\u201d said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 that lives in the forest that\u2019ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\u2019re gonna split inter two parties an\u2019 follow the trail in diff\u2019rent directions. There\u2019s blood all over the place, it must\u2019ve bin staggerin\u2019 around since last night at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want Fang,\u201d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\u2019s long teeth.\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\u2019s a coward,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cSo me, Harry, an\u2019 Hermione\u2019ll go one way an\u2019 Draco, Neville, an\u2019 Fang\u2019ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\u2019ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\u2019 practice now\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014an\u2019 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\u2019 we\u2019ll all come an\u2019 find yeh\u2014so, be careful\u2014let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves.\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n\n\u201cCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cNot fast enough,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\u201d\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Hermione?\u201d Hagrid whispered. \u201cDon\u2019 worry, it can\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt, an\u2019 then we\u2019ll be able ter\u2014GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s summat in here that shouldn\u2019 be.\u201d\n\n\u201cA werewolf?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019 no werewolf an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 no unicorn, neither,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cRight, follow me, but careful, now.\u201d\n\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Hagrid called. \u201cShow yerself\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nAnd into the clearing came\u2014was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\u2019s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\u2019s jaws dropped.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid in relief. \u201cHow are yeh?\u201d\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\u201d said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \u201cWere you going to shoot me?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \u201cThere\u2019s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\u2019 Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\u2019 this is Ronan, you two. He\u2019s a centaur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d noticed,\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d said Hermione timidly.\n\n\u201cA bit. Well, that\u2019s something.\u201d Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \u201cMars is bright tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \u201cListen, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \u2019cause there\u2019s a unicorn bin hurt\u2014you seen anythin\u2019?\u201d\n\nRonan didn\u2019t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\n\n\u201cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut have yeh seen anythin\u2019, Ronan? Anythin\u2019 unusual?\u201d\n\n\u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \u201cUnusually bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I was meanin\u2019 anythin\u2019 unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \u201cSo yeh haven\u2019t noticed anythin\u2019 strange?\u201d\n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \u201cThe forest hides many secrets.\u201d\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.\n\n\u201cHullo, Bane,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell enough. Look, I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin askin\u2019 Ronan, you seen anythin\u2019 odd in here lately? There\u2019s a unicorn bin injured\u2014would yeh know anythin\u2019 about it?\u201d\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Hagrid grumpily. \u201cWell, if either of you do see anythin\u2019, let me know, won\u2019t yeh? We\u2019ll be off, then.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Hagrid irritably, \u201ctry an\u2019 get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\u2019 closer\u2019n the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many of them in here?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, a fair few\u2026 Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\u2019re good enough about turnin\u2019 up if ever I want a word. They\u2019re deep mind, centaurs\u2026 they know things\u2026 jus\u2019 don\u2019 let on much.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\u2019s bin killin\u2019 the unicorns\u2014never heard anythin\u2019 like it before.\u201d\n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two wait here!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cStay on the path, I\u2019ll come back for yeh!\u201d\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\u2019t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been hurt, do you?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Malfoy has, but if something\u2019s got Neville\u2026 it\u2019s our fault he\u2019s here in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two were makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups\u2014Neville, you stay with me an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019ll have a harder time frightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n\n\u201cLook\u2014\u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves.\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered\u2026 Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\u2019s side, and began to drink its blood.\n\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted\u2014so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry\u2014unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry\u2014he couldn\u2019t move for fear.\n\nThen a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and a palomino body.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014thank you\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time\u2014especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.\n\n\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\n\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you realize who this is?\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been telling him?\u201d growled Bane. \u201cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\u201d\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\u201d he said in his gloomy voice.\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\n\u201cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\u201d\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\n\u201cDo you not see that unicorn?\u201d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \u201cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u201d\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s Bane so angry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\u201d\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\u2019s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u201cWe\u2019ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed, \u201cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else\u2014something that will bring you back to full strength and power\u2014something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! Of course\u2014the Elixir of Life! But I don\u2019t understand who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u201d\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Harry croaked, \u201cthat was Vol\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\u201d\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \u201cThe unicorn\u2019s dead, Hagrid, it\u2019s in that clearing back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \u201cYou are safe now.\u201d\n\nHarry slid off his back.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry Potter,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\u201d\n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\n\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\n\u201cSnape wants the stone for Voldemort\u2026 and Voldemort\u2019s waiting in the forest\u2026 and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying the name!\u201d said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\u2019t have done so\u2026 Bane was furious\u2026 he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen\u2026 They must show that Voldemort\u2019s coming back\u2026 Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me\u2026 I suppose that\u2019s written in the stars as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you stop saying the name!\u201d Ron hissed.\n\n\u201cSo all I\u2019ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\u201d Harry went on feverishly, \u201cthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off\u2026 Well, I suppose Bane\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n\n\u201cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\u2019t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\u2019s a very imprecise branch of magic.\u201d\n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\u2019s surprises weren\u2019t over.\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\n\nJust in case.\n\n\n\n\n\n16. THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\n\n\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\u2014points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\n\nMaybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\u2019t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the rest.\n\n\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \u201cI needn\u2019t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u201d\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \u201cNo more studying,\u201d Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \u201cYou could look more cheerful, Harry, we\u2019ve got a week before we find out how badly we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\u201d\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew what this means!\u201d he burst out angrily. \u201cMy scar keeps hurting\u2014it\u2019s happened before, but never as often as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ill,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a warning\u2026 it means danger\u2019s coming\u2026\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t get worked up, it was too hot.\n\n\u201cHarry, relax, Hermione\u2019s right, the Stone\u2019s safe as long as Dumbledore\u2019s around. Anyway, we\u2019ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\u2019s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\u2019d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \u201cThat\u2019s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\u2019d done that one.\u201d\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\u2019t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy\u2026 never\u2026 but\u2026\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d said Ron sleepily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d said Harry. He had turned white. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \u201cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\u2019t answer.\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\u2019ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Hagrid casually, \u201che wouldn\u2019 take his cloak off.\u201d\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head\u2014that\u2019s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\u2019 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\u201d\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \u201cWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cMighta come up,\u201d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \u201cYeah\u2026 he asked what I did, an\u2019 I told him I was gamekeeper here\u2026 He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after\u2026 so I told him\u2026 an\u2019 I said what I\u2019d always really wanted was a dragon\u2026 an\u2019 then\u2026 I can\u2019 remember too well, \u2019cause he kept buyin\u2019 me drinks\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\u2019 we could play cards fer it if I wanted\u2026 but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home\u2026 So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did he\u2014did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u201d Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014yeah\u2014how many three headed dogs d\u2019yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a piece o\u2019 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\u2019 play him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll go straight off ter sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u201d he blurted out. \u201cForget I said it! Hey\u2014where\u2019re yeh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\u2019t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak\u2014it must\u2019ve been easy, once he\u2019d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\u2019t stop him. Where\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to\u2014\u201d Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you three doing inside?\u201d\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\n\u201cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\n\u201cSee Professor Dumbledore?\u201d Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed\u2014now what?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of secret,\u201d he said, but he wished at once he hadn\u2019t, because Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils flared.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \u201cProfessor\u2014it\u2019s about the Sorcerer\u2019s stone\u2014\u201d\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\u2019t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\u2019t pick them up. \u201cHow do you know ?\u201d she spluttered.\n\n\u201cProfessor, I think\u2014I know\u2014that Sn\u2014that someone\u2019s going to try and steal the Stone. I\u2019ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\u2019s too well protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \u201cI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \u201cSnape\u2019s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\u2019s found out everything he needs, and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what can we\u2014\u201d\n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n\nSnape was standing there.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said smoothly.\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this,\u201d he said, with an odd, twisted smile.\n\n\u201cWe were\u2014\u201d Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n\n\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHanging around like this, people will think you\u2019re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\u2019t afford to lose any more points, can it?\u201d\n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n\n\u201cBe warned, Potter\u2014any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\u201d\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n\n\u201cRight, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape\u2014wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\u201d He put on a high voice, \u201c\u2018Oh Professor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d better stay outside the third floor corridor,\u201d Harry told Ron. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nBut that part of the plan didn\u2019t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n\n\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\u201d she stormed. \u201cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\u2019ve come anywhere near here again, I\u2019ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \u201cAt least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u201d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry!\u201d she wailed. \u201cSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\u2019ve only just got away, I don\u2019t know where Snape went.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out of here tonight and I\u2019m going to try and get to the Stone first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAfter what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\u2019ll be expelled!\u201d\n\n\u201cSO WHAT?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\u2019s coming back! Haven\u2019t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\u2019t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter anymore, can\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side! I\u2019m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\u201d\n\nHe glared at them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Harry,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s just lucky I got it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it cover all three of us?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAll\u2014all three of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, you don\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione briskly. \u201cHow do you think you\u2019d get to the Stone without us? I\u2019d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\u2019re not throwing me out after that.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\u2019t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n\n\u201cBetter get the cloak,\u201d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy\u2014he didn\u2019t feel much like singing.\n\nHe ran back down to the common room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\u2014if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\u2019d been making another bid for freedom.\n\n\u201cNothing, Neville, nothing,\u201d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going out again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, Neville?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go out,\u201d said Neville, \u201cyou\u2019ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthis is important.\u201d\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you do it,\u201d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d Ron exploded, \u201cget away from that hole and don\u2019t be an idiot\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u201d said Neville. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but not to us,\u201d said Ron in exasperation. \u201cNeville, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.\n\n\u201cGo on then, try and hit me!\u201d said Neville, raising his fists. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cDo something,\u201d he said desperately.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u201d\n\nShe raised her wand.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n\nNeville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done to him?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the full Body Bind,\u201d said Hermione miserably. \u201cOh, Neville, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u201d said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\u2019s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u201d Ron whispered in Harry\u2019s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThey didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \u201cKnow you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u201d\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n\n\u201cShould call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a creeping around unseen.\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\u201d\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n\n\u201cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\u201d he said greasily. \u201cMy mistake, my mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t see you\u2014of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible\u2014forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have business here, Peeves,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cStay away from this place tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\u201d said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \u201cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u201d\n\nAnd he scooted off.\n\n\u201cBrilliant, Harry!\u201d whispered Ron.\n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridor\u2014and the door was already ajar.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d Harry said quietly, \u201cSnape\u2019s already got past Fluffy.\u201d\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can take the cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry pushed the door open.\n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that at its feet?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cLooks like a harp,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape must have left it there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, here goes\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\u2019s growls ceased\u2014it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n\n\u201cKeep playing,\u201d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\u2019s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u201d said Ron, peering over the dog\u2019s back. \u201cWant to go first, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n\n\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Hermione said anxiously.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2014just black\u2014there\u2019s no way of climbing down, we\u2019ll just have to drop.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\n\n\u201cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\u201d\n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cSee you in a minute, I hope\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and\u2014\n\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \u201cit\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u201d\n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff?\u201d were his first words.\n\n\u201cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\u201d\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\u2019s other side.\n\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLucky!\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cLook at you both!\u201d\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.\n\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what this is\u2014it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a great help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\n\n\u201cDevil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare\u2026 what did Professor Sprout say?\u2014it likes the dark and the damp\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo light a fire!\u201d Harry choked.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014of course\u2014but there\u2019s no wood!\u201d Hermione cried, wringing her hands.\n\n\u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u201d Ron bellowed. \u201cARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\n\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a crisis\u2014\u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully grown dragon\u2014Norbert had been bad enough\u2026\n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 sounds like wings to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead\u2014I can see something moving.\u201d\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once\u2026 well, there\u2019s no other choice\u2026 I\u2019ll run.\u201d\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThese birds\u2026 they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering\u2014glittering?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re keys! Winged keys\u2014look carefully. So that must mean\u2026\u201d he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \u201c\u2026yes\u2014look! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are hundreds of them!\u201d\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a big, old fashioned one\u2014probably silver, like the handle.\u201d\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\u2019t. After a minute\u2019s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\n\u201cThat one!\u201d he called to the others. \u201cThat big one\u2014there\u2014no, there\u2014with bright blue wings\u2014the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\u201d\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to close in on it!\u201d Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \u201cRon, you come at it from above\u2014Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\u2019ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\u201d\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned\u2014it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly\u2014the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way across the room.\u201d\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Hermione nervously.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to be chessmen.\u201d\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\u2019s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\u201cDo we\u2014er\u2014have to join you to get across?\u201d The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cThis needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\u2019ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not offended,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cJust tell us what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go next to him instead of that castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a knight,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n\n\u201cWhite always plays first in chess,\u201d said Ron, peering across the board. \u201cYes\u2026 look\u2026\u201d\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014move diagonally four squares to the right.\u201d\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.\n\n\u201cHad to let that happen,\u201d said Ron, looking shaken. \u201cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\u201d\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cLet me think\u2014let me think\u2026\u201d\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Ron softly, \u201cIt\u2019s the only way\u2026 I\u2019ve got to be taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s chess!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\u2019ll take me\u2014that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t hurry up, he\u2019ll already have the Stone!\u201d\n\nThere was no alternative.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Ron called, his face pale but determined. \u201cHere I go\u2014now, don\u2019t hang around once you\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor\u2014Hermione screamed but stayed on her square\u2014the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\u2019d been knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\u2019s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\n\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, trying to convince himself. \u201cWhat do you reckon\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare; Flitwick must\u2019ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThey had reached another door.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHarry pushed it open.\n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u201d Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \u201cCome on, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next\u2014but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\u2019t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\n\n\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\n\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n\n\n\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\u2019s left side;\n\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\n\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n\n\n\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n\n\n\n\n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis isn\u2019t magic\u2014it\u2019s logic\u2014a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t got an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be stuck in here forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut so will we, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cEverything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we know which to drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d\n\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fire\u2014toward the Stone.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough there for one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly one swallow.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\u201d\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n\n\u201cYou drink that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\u2019ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy\u2014go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\u2019m no match for him, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry\u2014what if You-Know-Who\u2019s with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I was lucky once, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry, pointing at his scar. \u201cI might get lucky again.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014you\u2019re a great wizard, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you,\u201d said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBooks! And cleverness! There are more important things\u2014friendship and bravery and\u2014oh Harry\u2014be careful!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou drink first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou are sure which is which, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poison?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014but it\u2019s like ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, go, before it wears off.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck\u2014take care.\u201d\n\n\u201cGO!\u201d\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\n\n\u201cHere I come,\u201d he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\u2019t feel them\u2014for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\u2014then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there\u2014but it wasn\u2019t Snape. It wasn\u2019t even Voldemort.\n\n\n\n\n\n17. THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\n\n\n\nIt was Quirrell.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\u2019t twitching at all.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI wondered whether I\u2019d be meeting you here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought\u2014Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus?\u201d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\u2019t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \u201cYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\u2019t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take it in. This couldn\u2019t be true, it couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut Snape tried to kill me!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\u2019d have got you off that broom. I\u2019d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\u2019t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape was trying to save me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Quirrell coolly. \u201cWhy do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t do it again. Funny, really\u2026 he needn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular\u2026 and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u201d\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\u2019d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let the troll in?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls\u2014you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off\u2014and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three headed dog didn\u2019t even manage to bite Snape\u2019s leg off properly.\n\n\u201cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\u201d\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\n\u201cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\u201d Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \u201cTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like this\u2026 but he\u2019s in London\u2026 I\u2019ll be far away by the time he gets back\u2026\u201d\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\n\n\u201cI saw you and Snape in the forest\u2014\u201d he blurted out.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \u201cHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\u2019d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me\u2014as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n\n\u201cI see the Stone\u2026 I\u2019m presenting it to my master\u2026 but where is it?\u201d\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\u2019t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\n\u201cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he does,\u201d said Quirrell casually, \u201cheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\u2019t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing\u2014I thought Snape was threatening you\u2026\u201d\n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI find it hard to follow my master\u2019s instructions\u2014he is a great wizard and I am weak\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHe is with me wherever I go,\u201d said Quirrell quietly. \u201cI met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it\u2026 Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\u201d Quirrell shivered suddenly. \u201cHe does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me\u2026 decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He\u2019d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mind was racing.\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it\u2014which means I\u2019ll see where it\u2019s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\u2019m up to?\n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\n\n\u201cUse the boy\u2026 Use the boy\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014Potter\u2014come here.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Quirrell repeated. \u201cLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nHarry walked toward him.\n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\u2019s all.\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket\u2014and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow\u2014incredibly\u2014he\u2019d gotten the Stone.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impatiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\nHarry screwed up his courage.\n\n\u201cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u201d he invented. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nQuirrell cursed again.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips.\n\n\u201cHe lies\u2026 He lies\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me the truth! What did you just see?\u201d\n\nThe high voice spoke again.\n\n\u201cLet me speak to him\u2026 face-to-face\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, you are not strong enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have strength enough\u2026 for this\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter\u2026\u201d it whispered.\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the face said. \u201cMere shadow and vapor\u2026 I have form only when I can share another\u2019s body\u2026 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds\u2026 Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks\u2026 you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest\u2026 and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own\u2026 Now\u2026 why don\u2019t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\u201d\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\u2019s legs. He stumbled backward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d snarled the face. \u201cBetter save your own life and join me\u2026 or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents\u2026 They died begging me for mercy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted suddenly.\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.\n\n\u201cHow touching\u2026\u201d it hissed. \u201cI always value bravery\u2026 Yes, boy, your parents were brave\u2026 I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight\u2026 but your mother needn\u2019t have died\u2026 she was trying to protect you\u2026 Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \u201cSEIZE HIM!\u201d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened\u2014he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers\u2014they were blistering before his eyes.\n\n\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\u2019s neck\u2014Harry\u2019s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\n\u201cMaster, I cannot hold him\u2014my hands\u2014my hands!\u201d\n\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms\u2014Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\n\u201cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\u201d screeched Voldemort.\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain\u2014his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off\u2014the pain in Harry\u2019s head was building\u2014he couldn\u2019t see\u2014he could only hear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s yells of, \u201cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d and other voices, maybe in Harry\u2019s own head, crying, \u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down\u2026 down\u2026 down\u2026\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\n\nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \u201cSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who does? Sir, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\n\u201cTokens from your friends and admirers,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have I been in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sit, the Stone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feared I might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou nearly were, I couldn\u2019t have kept him off the Stone much longer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Stone, boy, you\u2014the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cBut your friend\u2014Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know about Nicolas?\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \u201cYou did do the thing properly, didn\u2019t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cTo one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all\u2014the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\u201d\n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 sir\u2014even if the Stone\u2019s gone, Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\u2019s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he hasn\u2019t gone, has he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share\u2026 not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time\u2014and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \u201cSir, there are some other things I\u2019d like to know, if you can tell me\u2026 things I want to know the truth about\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d Dumbledore sighed. \u201cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\u2019ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\u201d\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n\n\u201cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day\u2026 put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older\u2026 I know you hate to hear this\u2026 when you are ready, you will know.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\u201cBut why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t realize that love as powerful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign\u2026 to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\u201d\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \u201cAnd the Invisibility Cloak\u2014do you know who sent it to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2014your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cUseful things\u2026 your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s something else\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFire away.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirrell said Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, him\u2014Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saved his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore dreamily. \u201cFunny, the way people\u2019s minds work, isn\u2019t it? Professor Snape couldn\u2019t bear being in your father\u2019s debt\u2026 I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\u2019s memory in peace\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\n\n\u201cAnd sir, there\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, now, I\u2019m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\u2019s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone\u2014find it, but not use it\u2014would be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes\u2026 Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve rather lost my liking for them\u2014but I think I\u2019ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \u201cAlas! Ear wax!\u201d\n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\n\n\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Harry pleaded.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let Professor Dumbledore in\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut five minutes only.\u201d\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to\u2014Dumbledore was so worried\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s talking about it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat really happened?\u201d\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\u2019s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\u201cSo the Stone\u2019s gone?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cFlamel\u2019s just going to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that\u2014what was it?\u2014\u2018to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI always said he was off his rocker,\u201d said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to you two?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I got back all right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI brought Ron round\u2014that took a while\u2014and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall\u2014he already knew\u2014he just said, \u2018Harry\u2019s gone after him, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019 and hurtled off to the third floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he meant you to do it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cSending you your father\u2019s cloak and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione exploded, \u201cif he did\u2014I mean to say that\u2019s terrible\u2014you could have been killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\u2019s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Dumbledore\u2019s off his rocker, all right,\u201d said Ron proudly. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course\u2014you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you\u2014but the food\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\u201d she said firmly.\n\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the feast,\u201d he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \u201cI can, can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\u201d she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\u2019t realize how risky feasts could be. \u201cAnd you have another visitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014all\u2014my\u2014ruddy\u2014fault!\u201d he sobbed, his face in his hands. \u201cI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\u2019t know, an\u2019 I told him! Yeh could\u2019ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\u2019ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\u2019 made ter live as a Muggle!\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \u201cHagrid, he\u2019d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\u2019re talking about, he\u2019d have found out even if you hadn\u2019t told him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh could\u2019ve died!\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 say the name!\u201d\n\n\u201cVOLDEMORT!\u201d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \u201cI\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\u2019ve got loads\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \u201cThat reminds me. I\u2019ve got yeh a present.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\u201d said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\n\n\u201cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \u2019Course, he shoulda sacked me instead\u2014anyway, got yeh this\u2026\u201d\n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\n\n\u201cSent owls off ter all yer parents\u2019 old school friends, askin\u2019 fer photos\u2026 knew yeh didn\u2019 have any\u2026 d\u2019yeh like it?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t speak, but Hagrid understood.\n\nHarry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\u2019s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\u2019s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\n\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u201cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were\u2026 you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts\u2026\n\n\u201cNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\u201d\n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, recent events must be taken into account.\u201d\n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little.\n\n\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes\u2026\n\n\u201cFirst\u2014to Mr. Ronald Weasley\u2026\u201d\n\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n\n\u201c\u2026for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \u201cMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\u2019s giant chess set!\u201d\n\nAt last there was silence again.\n\n\u201cSecond\u2014to Miss Hermione Granger\u2026 for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves\u2014they were a hundred points up.\n\n\u201cThird\u2014to Mr. Harry Potter\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet \u201c\u2026for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\u201d\n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points\u2014exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup\u2014if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of courage,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\u201d\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \u201cwe need a little change of decoration.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s feelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls\u2026 he would never, ever forget tonight.\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life.\n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us these,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross Station.\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\u2019t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\n\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron, \u201cboth of you\u2014I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look forward to.\u201d People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\n\n\u201cBye, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cStill famous,\u201d said Ron, grinning at him.\n\n\u201cNot where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \u201cThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!\u201d\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she wasn\u2019t pointing at Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook, Mom! I can see\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\n\u201cBusy year?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was nothing, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady, are you?\u201d\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou must be Harry\u2019s family!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cHurry up, boy, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d He walked away.\n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cSee you over the summer, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope you have\u2014er\u2014a good holiday,\u201d said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re not allowed to use magic at home. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\nSay you\u2019ve spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J. K. Rowling\u2019s enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. In the nonmagic human world\u2014the world of \u201cMuggles\u201d\u2014Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he\u2019s quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley.\n\nA mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: \u201cWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, \u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig\u2026 and that\u2019s where the real adventure\u2014humorous, haunting, and suspenseful\u2014begins.

K. version of the Newbery Medal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Jessica, who loves stories,\n\nFor Anne, who loved them too;\n\nAnd for Di, who heard this one first.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. THE BOY WHO LIVED\n\n\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n\n\u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar\u2014a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen\u2014then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive\u2014no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes\u2014the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt\u2014these people were obviously collecting for something\u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes, their son, Harry\u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking\u2026 no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her\u2014if he\u2019d had a sister like that\u2026 but all the same, those people in cloaks\u2026\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\u2014and it didn\u2019t improve his mood\u2014was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\n\u201cAnd finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early\u2014it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters\u2026\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr\u2014Petunia, dear\u2014you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n\u201cWell, I just thought\u2026 maybe\u2026 it was something to do with\u2026 you know\u2026 her crowd.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son\u2014he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did\u2026 if it got out that they were related to a pair of\u2014well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind\u2026 He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on\u2014he yawned and turned over\u2014it couldn\u2019t affect them\u2026\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\u2014the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\n\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n\u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no\u2014even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent\u2014I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense\u2014for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you haven\u2019t\u201d, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You Know\u2014oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re too\u2014well\u2014noble to use them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying,\u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are\u2014are\u2014that they\u2019re\u2014dead.\u201d\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\u201cLily and James\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to believe it\u2026 Oh, Albus\u2026\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u201cI know\u2026 I know\u2026\u201d he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potter\u2019s son, Harry. But\u2014he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke\u2014and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s true?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done\u2026 all the people he\u2019s killed\u2026 he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding\u2026 of all the things to stop him\u2026 but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may never know.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all places?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014you can\u2019t mean the people who live here?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore\u2014you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got this son\u2014I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous\u2014a legend\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future\u2014there will be books written about Harry\u2014every child in our world will know his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes\u2014yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2014wise\u2014to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky\u2014and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild\u2014long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir\u2014house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\u201cIs that where\u2014?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that scar forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well\u2014give him here, Hagrid\u2014we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cCould I\u2014could I say good bye to him, sir?\u201d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the Muggles!\u201d\n\n\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-can\u2019t stand it\u2014Lily an\u2019 James dead\u2014an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be takin\u2019 Sirius his bike back. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall\u2014Professor Dumbledore, sir.\u201d\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\n\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley\u2026 He couldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Potter\u2014the boy who lived!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE VANISHING GLASS\n\n\n\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets\u2014but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s birthday\u2014how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise\u2014unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask questions\u2014that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way\u2014all over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\u2014Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\n\u201cThirty six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, thirty seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\u201d\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty\u2026 thirty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction.\n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there\u2014or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug.\n\n\u201cWhat about what\u2019s her name, your friend\u2014Yvonne?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon.\n\n\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she snarled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026and leave him in the car\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying\u2014it had been years since he\u2019d really cried\u2014but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 want\u2026 him\u2026 t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang\u2014\u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically\u2014and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy\u2014any funny business, anything at all\u2014and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls)\u2014The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\n\n\u201c\u2026roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon\u2014they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can\u2014but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself\u2014no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see\u2014so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened\u2014one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come\u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo\u2014cupboard\u2014stay\u2014no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\n\n\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n\n\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it\u2014it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings\u2019 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High\u2014like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and\u2014a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives\u2014he didn\u2019t belong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\n\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\n\n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\n\n\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d said Dudley suddenly. \u201cDad, Harry\u2019s got something!\u201d\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness\u2014Vernon!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley.\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n\n\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address\u2014how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching\u2014spying\u2014might be following us,\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an answer\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s best\u2026 we won\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we swear when we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\u201d\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my cupboard on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, Harry\u2014about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking\u2026 you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it\u2026 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there\u2026 I need that room\u2026 make him get out\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cGo to your cupboard\u2014I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley\u2014go\u2014just go.\u201d\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat\u2014something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\n\u201cI want\u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno damn letters today\u2014\u201d\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one\u2014\n\n\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n\n\u201cShake \u2019em off\u2026 shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television programs he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering\u2026\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\n\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great Humberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u201d\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday\u2014and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television\u2014then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun\u2014last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.\n\n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds\u2026 twenty\u2026 ten\u2026 nine\u2014maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him\u2014three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\n\n\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cannon?\u201d he said stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands\u2014now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then\u2014\n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy journey\u2026\u201d\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n\n\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\n\u201cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are breaking and entering!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n\n\u201cAnyway\u2014Harry,\u201d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here\u2014I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u201d\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u2019s whole arm.\n\n\u201cWhat about that tea then, eh?\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together. \u201cI\u2019d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\u2019ve got it, mind.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath.\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n\u201cYer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019 anymore, Dursley, don\u2019 worry.\u201d\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\n\u201cCall me Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone does. An\u2019 like I told yeh, I\u2019m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts\u2014yeh\u2019ll know all about Hogwarts, o\u2019 course.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014no,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said quickly.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019 s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\u2019t gettin\u2019 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\u2019t even know abou\u2019 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll what?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cALL WHAT?\u201d Hagrid thundered. \u201cNow wait jus\u2019 one second!\u201d\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n\u201cDo you mean ter tell me,\u201d he growled at the Dursleys, \u201cthat this boy\u2014this boy!\u2014knows nothin\u2019 abou\u2019\u2014about ANYTHING?\u201d\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u201cI know some things,\u201d he said. \u201cI can, you know, do math and stuff.\u201d But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \u201cAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u2019 world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\n\u201cDURSLEY!\u201d he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \u201cMimblewimble.\u201d Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n\n\u201cBut yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re famous. You\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? My\u2014my mom and dad weren\u2019t famous, were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know\u2026 yeh don\u2019 know\u2026\u201d Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know what yeh are?\u201d he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he commanded. \u201cStop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\u201d\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\n\n\u201cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\u2019 you\u2019ve kept it from him all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cKept what from me?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\u201cAh, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry\u2014yer a wizard.\u201d\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d gasped Harry.\n\n\u201cA wizard, o\u2019 course,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \u201can\u2019 a thumpin\u2019 good\u2019un, I\u2019d say, once yeh\u2019ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\u2019 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\u2019 I reckon it\u2019s abou\u2019 time yeh read yer letter.\u201d\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut on the Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\n\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\u2019s head like fireworks and he couldn\u2019t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \u201cWhat does it mean, they await my owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cGallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl\u2014a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl\u2014a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going,\u201d he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry, interested.\n\n\u201cA Muggle,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cit\u2019s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\u2019 it\u2019s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\u2019 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe swore when we took him in we\u2019d put a stop to that rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cswore we\u2019d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou knew I\u2019m a\u2014a wizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew!\u201d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \u201cKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that\u2014that school\u2014and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was\u2014a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\u201d\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n\n\u201cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\u2019d be just the same, just as strange, just as\u2014as\u2014abnormal\u2014and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\u201d\n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \u201cBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\u201d\n\n\u201cCAR CRASH!\u201d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \u201cHow could a car crash kill Lily an\u2019 James Potter? It\u2019s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\u2019 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why? What happened?\u201d Harry asked urgently.\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\u2019s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\n\n\u201cI never expected this,\u201d he said, in a low, worried voice. \u201cI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\u2019 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\u2019t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u2019 know if I\u2019m the right person ter tell yeh\u2014but someone\u2019s gotta\u2014yeh can\u2019t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh\u2014mind, I can\u2019t tell yeh everythin\u2019, it\u2019s a great myst\u2019ry, parts of it\u2026\u201d\n\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \u201cIt begins, I suppose, with\u2014with a person called\u2014but it\u2019s incredible yeh don\u2019t know his name, everyone in our world knows\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I don\u2019 like sayin\u2019 the name if I can help it. No one does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cGulpin\u2019 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went\u2026 bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\n\n\u201cCould you write it down?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cNah can\u2019t spell it. All right\u2014Voldemort.\u201d Hagrid shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again. Anyway, this\u2014this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\u2019 fer followers. Got \u2019em, too\u2014some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\u2019 his power, \u2019cause he was gettin\u2019 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\u2019t know who ter trust, didn\u2019t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches\u2026 terrible things happened. He was takin\u2019 over. \u2019Course, some stood up to him\u2014an\u2019 he killed \u2019em. Horribly. One o\u2019 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u2019t dare try takin\u2019 the school, not jus\u2019 then, anyway.\n\n\u201cNow, yer mum an\u2019 dad were as good a witch an\u2019 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\u2019 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\u2019ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get \u2019em on his side before\u2026 probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\u2019 ter do with the Dark Side.\n\n\u201cMaybe he thought he could persuade \u2019em\u2026 maybe he just wanted \u2019em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\u2019\u2014an\u2019\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s that sad\u2014knew yer mum an\u2019 dad, an\u2019 nicer people yeh couldn\u2019t find\u2014anyway\u2026\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who killed \u2019em. An\u2019 then\u2014an\u2019 this is the real myst\u2019ry of the thing\u2014he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\u2019 by then. But he couldn\u2019t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u2019s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh\u2014took care of yer mum an\u2019 dad an\u2019 yer house, even\u2014but it didn\u2019t work on you, an\u2019 that\u2019s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u2018em, no one except you, an\u2019 he\u2019d killed some o\u2019 the best witches an\u2019 wizards of the age\u2014the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts\u2014an\u2019 you was only a baby, an\u2019 you lived.\u201d\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u2019s mind. As Hagrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before\u2014and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\n\n\u201cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\u2019s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLoad of old tosh,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\n\n\u201cNow, you listen here, boy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cI accept there\u2019s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\u2019t have cured\u2014and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\u2019s better off without them in my opinion\u2014asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types\u2014just what I expected, always knew they\u2019d come to a sticky end\u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dursley\u2014I\u2019m warning you\u2014one more word\u2026\u201d\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\n\n\u201cBut what happened to Vol\u2014, sorry\u2014I mean, You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u2019s the biggest myst\u2019ry, see\u2026 he was gettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful\u2014why\u2019d he go?\n\n\u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\u2019s still out there, bidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. Don\u2019 reckon they could\u2019ve done if he was comin\u2019 back.\n\n\u201cMost of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause somethin\u2019 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he hadn\u2019t counted on\u2014I dunno what it was, no one does\u2014but somethin\u2019 about you stumped him, all right.\u201d\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time they\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI think you must have made a mistake. I don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\n\u201cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it\u2026 every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry\u2026 chased by Dudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach\u2026 dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow back\u2026 and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him?\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry Potter, not a wizard\u2014you wait, you\u2019ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a fight.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u201d he hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to Stonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish\u2014spell books and wands and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop him,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cStop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s son goin\u2019 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u2019s been down ever since he was born. He\u2019s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\u2019t know himself. He\u2019ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \u201cNEVER,\u201d he thundered, \u201c\u2014INSULT\u2014ALBUS\u2014DUMBLEDORE\u2014IN\u2014FRONT\u2014OF\u2014ME!\u201d\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\u2014there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\u2019s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019ta lost me temper,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\u2019t much left ter do.\u201d\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n\u201cBe grateful if yeh didn\u2019t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014er\u2014not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\u2019. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\u2019 get yer letters to yeh an\u2019 stuff\u2014one o\u2019 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you supposed to do magic?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, well\u2014I was at Hogwarts meself but I\u2014er\u2014got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\u2019 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and we\u2019ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\u201d said Hagrid loudly. \u201cGotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\u2019 that.\u201d\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou can kip under that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\u2019 dormice in one o\u2019 the pockets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. DIAGON ALLEY\n\n\n\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he told himself firmly. \u201cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard.\u201d\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s an owl\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPay him,\u201d Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets\u2014bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags\u2026 finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.\n\n\u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n\u201cKnuts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n\u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\n\n\u201cUm\u2014Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any money\u2014and you heard Uncle Vernon last night\u2026 he won\u2019t pay for me to go and learn magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \u201cD\u2019yeh think yer parents didn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if their house was destroyed\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a sausage, they\u2019re not bad cold\u2014an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no teh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cWizards have banks?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n\u201cGoblins?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe\u2014\u2019cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\u2019 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\u201d Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \u201cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\u2019 you gettin\u2019 things from Gringotts\u2014knows he can trust me, see.\n\n\u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n\n\u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cFlew?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter use magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\n\u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter\u2014er\u2014speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\n\u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cSpells\u2014enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way\u2014Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die of hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\u201d\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life.\n\n\u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u201d\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \u201cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \u201cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so they say,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCrikey, I\u2019d like a dragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted one ever since I was a kid\u2014here we go.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t understand \u201cMuggle money,\u201d as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\n\n\u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s a list there of everything yeh need.\u201d\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t noticed the night before, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\nFirst year students will require:\n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\n\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\n\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\n\n4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)\n\nPlease note that all pupils\u2019 clothes should carry name tags\n\nCOURSE BOOKS\n\nAll students should have a copy of each of the following:\n\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\n\nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\n\nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\n\nA Beginners\u2019 Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch\n\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\n\nMagical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander\n\nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self Protection by Quentin Trimble\n\nOTHER EQUIPMENT\n\n1 wand\n\n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set\n\n1 set of glass or crystal phials\n\n1 telescope set\n\n1 brass scales\n\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\n\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS\n\n\n\n\u201cCan we buy all this in London?\u201d Harry wondered aloud.\n\n\u201cIf yeh know where to go,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual, Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees buckle.\n\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis this\u2014can this be ?\u201d\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n\u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry Potter\u2026 what an honor.\u201d\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n\u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand\u2014I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\u201d Harry shook hands again and again\u2014Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\n\u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\u201d He looked terrified at the very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\n\u201cMust get on\u2014lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n\u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh\u2014mind you, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience\u2026 They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag\u2014never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\n\u201cThree up\u2026 two across,\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight, stand back, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered\u2014it wriggled\u2014in the middle, a small hole appeared\u2014it grew wider and wider\u2014a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\nHe grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons\u2014All Sizes\u2014Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver\u2014Self Stirring\u2014Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we gotta get yer money first.\u201d\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u201cDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad\u2026\u201d\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium\u2014Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of them say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand\u2014fastest ever\u2014\u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon\u2026\n\n\u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was\u2014\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\n\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\n\n\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours,\n\nThief, you have been warned, beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike I said, Yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More \u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in\u2014Hagrid with some difficulty\u2014and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late\u2014they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d\n\n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry\u2019s\u2014it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n\n\u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said Griphook.\n\n\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least\u2014but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life\u2014more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n\n\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here\u2014another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n\u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n\n\u201cI do\u2014Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been\u2014imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n\n\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\n\n\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage\u2014lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the drawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know\u2014not knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s.\n\n\u201c\u2014and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were\u2014he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\u2019 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in \u2019em in a long line o\u2019 Muggles\u2014look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like\u2014like soccer in the Muggle world\u2014everyone follows Quidditch\u2014played up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls\u2014sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\n\u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d\n\n\u201cVol\u2014sorry\u2014You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\n\n\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of the curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d\n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again.\n\n\u201cJust yer wand left\u2014A yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birthday present.\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at\u2014an\u2019 I don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander\u2019s left now\u2014only place fer wands, Ollivander\u2019s, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d\n\nA magic wand\u2026 this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it\u2014it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands\u2026 well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do\u2026\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again\u2026 Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now\u2014Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014well, I\u2019m right handed,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n\n\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried\u2014but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n\n\u201cNo, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere\u2014I wonder, now\u2014yes, why not\u2014unusual combination\u2014holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well\u2026 how curious\u2026 how very curious\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious\u2026 curious\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather\u2014just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it\u2019s brother\u2014why, it\u2019s brother gave you that scar.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n\u201cYes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember\u2026 I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter\u2026 After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things\u2014terrible, yes, but great.\u201d\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birthday of his life\u2014and yet\u2014he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander\u2026 but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol\u2014sorry\u2014I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d\n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts\u2014I did\u2014still do, \u2019smatter of fact.\u201d\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\n\n\u201cYer ticket fer Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst o\u2019 September\u2014King\u2019s Cross\u2014it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll know where to find me\u2026 See yeh soon, Harry.\u201d\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him\u2014in fact, they didn\u2019t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Uncle Vernon?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to\u2014to go to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n\u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u201d\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\n\u201cFunny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cWhere is this school, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\u2019clock,\u201d he read.\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\n\u201cPlatform what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on my ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201chowling mad, the lot of them. You\u2019ll see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take you to King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\n\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle Vernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\u201d\n\nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes\u2014he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine\u2014platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do they?\u201d\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\n\n\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2014packed with Muggles, of course\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\u2019s in front of him\u2014and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s the platform number?\u201d said the boys\u2019 mother.\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters!\u201d piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, \u201cMom, can\u2019t I go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\u201d\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it\u2014but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n\u201cFred, you next,\u201d the plump woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u201d said the boy. \u201cHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m George?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, George, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, I am Fred,\u201d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone\u2014but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there\u2014and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\u2019t anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s new, too.\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe thing is\u2014the thing is, I don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to get onto the platform?\u201d she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\u2019d be in trouble\u2014leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run\u2014the barrier was coming nearer and nearer\u2014he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop\u2014the cart was out of control\u2014he was a foot away\u2014he closed his eyes ready for the crash\u2014\n\nIt didn\u2019t come\u2026 he kept on running\u2026 he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o\u2019clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-quarters on it. He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying, \u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Neville,\u201d he heard the old woman sigh.\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\n\u201cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\u201d\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\n\u201cWant a hand?\u201d It was one of the red haired twins he\u2019d followed through the barrier.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry panted.\n\n\u201cOy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u201d\n\nWith the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\u2019s lightning scar.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said the first twin. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he added to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d chorused the twins.\n\n\u201cOh, him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, yes, I am.\u201d\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\u2019s open door.\n\n\u201cFred? George? Are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing, Mom.\u201d\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n\u201cRon, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u201d\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n\u201cMom\u2014geroff\u2014\u201d He wriggled free.\n\n\u201cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Percy?\u201d said their mother.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\u201d said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \u201cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cOnce\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr twice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA minute\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll summer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Percy the Prefect.\n\n\u201cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a prefect,\u201d said their mother fondly. \u201cAll right, dear, well, have a good term\u2014send me an owl when you get there.\u201d\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n\n\u201cNow, you two\u2014this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve blown up a toilet or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. And look after Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n\n\u201cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\u201d\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him looking.\n\n\u201cYou know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the little girl\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\u2019t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\u2019s really there\u2014like lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor dear\u2014no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\u201d\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n\u201cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, keep your hair on.\u201d\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, Mom.\u201d\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\n\n\u201cAnyone sitting there?\u201d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \u201cEverywhere else is full.\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\n\n\u201cHey, Ron.\u201d\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re going down the middle of the train\u2014Lee Jordan\u2019s got a giant tarantula down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d mumbled Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said the other twin, \u201cdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\n\n\u201cAre you really Harry Potter?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\u2019s jokes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd have you really got\u2014you know\u2026\u201d\n\nHe pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where You-Know-Who\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\n\u201cAre all your family wizards?\u201d asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Yes, I think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think Mom\u2019s got a second cousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you must know loads of magic already.\u201d\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\n\u201cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat are they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible\u2014well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\u2019d had three wizard brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \u201cI\u2019m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\u2019ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left\u2014Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\u2019re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand, and Percy\u2019s old rat.\u201d\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Scabbers and he\u2019s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\u2019t aff\u2014I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\u2019s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\n\u201c\u2026and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\u2014\u201d\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou said You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u201d said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you, of all people\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI just never knew you shouldn\u2019t. See what I mean? I\u2019ve got loads to learn\u2026 I bet,\u201d he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \u201cI bet I\u2019m the worst in the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be. There\u2019s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\u201d\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \u201cAnything off the cart, dears?\u201d\n\nHarry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\u2019s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\u2019d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry\u2014but the woman didn\u2019t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\n\n\u201cHungry, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStarving,\u201d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \u201cShe always forgets I don\u2019t like corned beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwap you for one of these,\u201d said Harry, holding up a pasty. \u201cGo on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, it\u2019s all dry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t got much time,\u201d he added quickly, \u201cyou know, with five of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, have a pasty,\u201d said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\u2019s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \u201cThey\u2019re not really frogs, are they?\u201d He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut see what the card is. I\u2019m missing Agrippa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course, you wouldn\u2019t know\u2014Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect\u2014famous witches and wizards. I\u2019ve got about five hundred, but I haven\u2019t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\u201d\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\u2019s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSo this is Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d never heard of Dumbledore!\u201d said Ron. \u201cCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa\u2014thanks\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\n\n\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\u2019s face had disappeared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again and I\u2019ve got about six of her\u2026 do you want it? You can start collecting.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u201d Ron sounded amazed. \u201cWeird!\u201d\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\u201cYou want to be careful with those,\u201d Ron warned Harry. \u201cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor\u2014you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\u201d\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n\n\u201cBleaaargh\u2014see? Sprouts.\u201d\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you seen a toad at all?\u201d\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \u201cI\u2019ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll turn up,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy miserably. \u201cWell, if you see him\u2026\u201d\n\nHe left.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf I\u2019d brought a toad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cHe might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference,\u201d said Ron in disgust. \u201cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, look\u2026\u201d\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n\n\u201cUnicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway\u2014\u201d\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\u2019s lost one,\u201d she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already told him we haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Ron, but the girl wasn\u2019t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\n\u201cOh, are you doing magic? Let\u2019s see it, then.\u201d\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014all right.\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\u2019s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\u2019s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\u2019ve heard\u2014I\u2019ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough\u2014I\u2019m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\u201d\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\u2019t learned all the course books by heart either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ron Weasley,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAre you really?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI know all about you, of course\u2014I got a few extra books for background reading, and you\u2019re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n\u201cGoodness, didn\u2019t you know, I\u2019d have found out everything I could if it was me,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDo either of you know what house you\u2019ll be in? I\u2019ve been asking around, and I hope I\u2019m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u2026 Anyway, we\u2019d better go and look for Neville\u2019s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n\u201cWhatever house I\u2019m in, I hope she\u2019s not in it,\u201d said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \u201cStupid spell\u2014George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat house are your brothers in?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cGryffindor,\u201d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \u201cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll say if I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the house Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\u2019 whiskers are a bit lighter,\u201d said Harry, trying to take Ron\u2019s mind off houses. \u201cSo what do your oldest brothers do now that they\u2019ve left, anyway?\u201d\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\u2019d finished school.\n\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\u2019s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDid you hear about Gringotts? It\u2019s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\u2019t suppose you get that with the Muggles\u2014someone tried to rob a high security vault.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cReally? What happened to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such big news. They haven\u2019t been caught. My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\u2019t think they took anything, that\u2019s what\u2019s odd. \u2019Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u201d\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \u201cVoldemort\u201d without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite Quidditch team?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I don\u2019t know any,\u201d Harry confessed.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Ron looked dumbfounded. \u201cOh, you wait, it\u2019s the best game in the world\u2014\u201d And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\u2019d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\u2019d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\u2019t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\u2019d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\u2019s in this compartment. So it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\n\n\u201cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u201d said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \u201cAnd my name\u2019s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n\n\u201cThink my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\u201d\n\nHe turned back to Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry didn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\u201d he said coolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn\u2019t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\u2019t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\u2019ll rub off on you.\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to fight us, are you?\u201d Malfoy sneered.\n\n\u201cUnless you get out now,\u201d said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\u2019ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\u201d\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron\u2014Ron leapt forward, but before he\u2019d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\u2019s knuckle\u2014Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\u2019d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n\n\u201cWhat has been going on?\u201d she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u201d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t believe it\u2014he\u2019s gone back to sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met Malfoy before?\u201d\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of his family,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\u2019d been bewitched. My dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He says Malfoy\u2019s father didn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\u201d He turned to Hermione. \u201cCan we help you with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\u2019re nearly there. You haven\u2019t been fighting, have you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we even get there!\u201d\n\n\u201cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\u201d said Ron, scowling at her. \u201cWould you mind leaving while we change?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\u201d said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\u201d\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: \u201cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \u201cFirs\u2019 years! Firs\u2019 years over here! All right there, Harry?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, follow me\u2014any more firs\u2019 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\u2019 years follow me!\u201d\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019 all get yer firs\u2019 sight o\u2019 Hogwarts in a sec,\u201d Hagrid called over his shoulder, \u201cjus\u2019 round this bend here.\u201d\n\nThere was a loud \u201cOooooh!\u201d\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n\u201cNo more\u2019n four to a boat!\u201d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.\n\n\u201cEveryone in?\u201d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \u201cRight then\u2014FORWARD!\u201d\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n\u201cHeads down!\u201d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n\n\u201cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\u201d said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\n\n\u201cTrevor!\u201d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.\n\n\u201cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\u201d\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. THE SORTING HAT\n\n\n\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\u2019s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\n\n\u201cThe firs\u2019 years, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\u2019 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here\u2014but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Hogwarts,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThe start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n\n\u201cThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\n\u201cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\u201d\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\u2019s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\u2019s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n\n\u201cI shall return when we are ready for you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cPlease wait quietly.\u201d\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\u201cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\u201d he asked Ron.\n\n\u201cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet\u2014what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\u2019t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\u2019d learned and wondering which one she\u2019d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\u2019d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his teacher\u2019s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air\u2014several people behind him screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\u2019s not really even a ghost\u2014I say, what are you all doing here?\u201d\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\u201cNew students!\u201d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \u201cAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?\u201d\n\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\n\u201cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\u201d said the Friar. \u201cMy old house, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove along now,\u201d said a sharp voice. \u201cThe Sorting Ceremony\u2019s about to start.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \u201cand follow me.\u201d\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the heavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in the house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing\u2014noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth\u2014and the hat began to sing:\n\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty,\n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see,\n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\n\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\n\nSet Gryffindors apart;\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\n\nAnd unafraid of toil;\n\n\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nIf you\u2019ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\n\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYou\u2019ll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\n\n\nSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid!\n\nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap!\n\nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u201d Ron whispered to Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott, Hannah!\u201d\n\nA pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause\u2014\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat.\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\n\n\u201cBones, Susan!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n\n\u201cBoot, Terry!\u201d\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n\n\u201cBrocklehurst, Mandy\u201d went to Ravenclaw too, but \u201cBrown, Lavender\u201d became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\u2019s twin brothers catcalling.\n\n\u201cBulstrode, Millicent\u201d then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\u2019s imagination, after all he\u2019d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n\n\u201cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \u201cFinnigan, Seamus,\u201d the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cGranger, Hermione!\u201d\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n\n\u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\u2019re very nervous. What if he wasn\u2019t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\u2019d better get back on the train?\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR,\u201d Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \u201cMacDougal, Morag.\u201d\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many people left now. \u201cMoon\u201d\u2026, \u201cNott\u201d\u2026, \u201cParkinson\u201d\u2026, then a pair of twin girls, \u201cPatil\u201d and \u201cPatil\u201d\u2026, then \u201cPerks, Sally Anne\u201d\u2026, and then, at last\u2014\n\n\u201cPotter, Harry!\u201d\n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n\n\u201cPotter, did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said a small voice in his ear. \u201cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\u2019s talent, ah my goodness, yes\u2014and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s interesting\u2026 So where shall I put you?\u201d\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n\n\u201cNot Slytherin, eh?\u201d said the small voice. \u201cAre you sure? You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that\u2014no? Well, if you\u2019re sure\u2014better be GRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \u201cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\u201d Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water.\n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ron, excellent,\u201d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \u201cZabini, Blaise,\u201d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not.\n\n\u201cIs he\u2014a bit mad?\u201d he asked Percy uncertainly.\n\n\u201cMad?\u201d said Percy airily. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n\n\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \u201cCan\u2019t you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who you are!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cMy brothers told me about you\u2014you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy\u2014\u201d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\n\n\u201cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u201d\n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t going at all the way he wanted.\n\n\u201cLike this,\u201d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \u201cSo\u2014new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s becoming almost unbearable\u2014he\u2019s the Slytherin ghost.\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cHow did he get covered in blood?\u201d asked Seamus with great interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding\u2014\u201d\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m half-and-half,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cMe dad\u2019s a Muggle. Mom didn\u2019t tell him she was a witch \u2019til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\u201d\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Neville?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u201d said Neville, \u201cbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me\u2014he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned\u2014but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced\u2014all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here\u2014they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\u201d\n\nOn Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\u201cI do hope they start right away, there\u2019s so much to learn, I\u2019m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\u2019s supposed to be very difficult\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing\u2014\u201d).\n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s eyes\u2014and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Percy.\n\n\u201cN-nothing.\u201d\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\u2019s look\u2014a feeling that he didn\u2019t like Harry at all.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u201d he asked Percy.\n\n\u201cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\u2019s looking so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\u2019t want to\u2014everyone knows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\u201d\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\u2019t look at him again.\n\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\n\u201cAhem\u2014just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notices to give you.\n\n\u201cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\n\u201cI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\n\u201cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\u201d\n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not serious?\u201d he muttered to Percy.\n\n\u201cMust be,\u201d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re not allowed to go somewhere\u2014the forest\u2019s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\u201d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\u2019 smiles had become rather fixed.\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\n\u201cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand off we go!\u201d\n\nAnd the school bellowed:\n\nHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\n\nTeach us something please,\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees,\n\n\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff,\n\nFor now they\u2019re bare and full of air,\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\n\n\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\n\nBring back what we\u2019ve forgot,\n\nJust do your best, we\u2019ll do the rest,\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\n\u201cAh, music,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\u2019s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d Percy whispered to the first years. \u201cA poltergeist.\u201d He raised his voice, \u201cPeeves\u2014show yourself!\u201d\n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\u201d\n\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n\n\u201cOooooooh!\u201d he said, with an evil cackle. \u201cIckle Firsties! What fun!\u201d\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\n\u201cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I mean it!\u201d barked Percy.\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\n\u201cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\u201d said Percy, as they set off again. \u201cThe Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one who can control him, he won\u2019t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\u201d\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCaput Draconis,\u201d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it\u2014Neville needed a leg up\u2014and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase\u2014they were obviously in one of the towers\u2014they found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\n\u201cGreat food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \u201cGet off, Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my sheets.\u201d\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\u2019s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully\u2014and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it\u2014then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold\u2014there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. THE POTIONS MASTER\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere, look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWearing the glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his scar?\u201d\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\n\nThere were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u2019t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\n\nThe ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \u201cGOT YOUR CONK!\u201d\n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\u2019s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u2019d whisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u2019s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\u201cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\u2019t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\u2019t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u2019t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have much of a head start.\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got today?\u201d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\n\n\u201cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape\u2019s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them\u2014we\u2019ll be able to see if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish McGonagall favored us,\u201d said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\u2019t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\n\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. Snape didn\u2019t dislike Harry\u2014he hated him.\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAh, Yes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new\u2014celebrity.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had none of Hagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\u2014like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\u2026 I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death\u2014if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d\n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\u2019t a dunderhead.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot into the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSnape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\u201cTut, tut\u2014fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\nHe ignored Hermione\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201d\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\u201d Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\u201d\n\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione does, though, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d\n\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \u201cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \u201cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\u201d\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\n\n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014Potter\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\u201d\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u2019d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week\u2014why did Snape hate him so much?\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Ron, \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\u201d\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u2019s voice rang out, saying, \u201cBack, Fang\u2014back.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d he said. \u201cBack, Fang.\u201d\n\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\n\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\n\u201cMake yerselves at home,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\n\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s freckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\u201d\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u2019s knee and drooled all over his robes.\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \u201cthat old git.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get rid of her\u2014Fitch puts her up to it.\u201d\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\n\u201cBut he seemed to really hate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhy should he?\u201d\n\nYet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u201d Hagrid asked Ron. \u201cI liked him a lot\u2014great with animals.\u201d\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\n\n\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t mentioned the date.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It might\u2019ve been happening while we were there!\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t meet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u2019d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u2019t want to tell Harry?\n\n\n\n\n\n9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\n\n\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u2019t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday\u2014and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\u201d\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cAnyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u2019s all talk.\u201d\n\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of a book\u2014not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\u2019s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Remembrall!\u201d he explained. \u201cGran knows I forget things\u2014this tells you if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red\u2014oh\u2026\u201d His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u201c\u2026you\u2019ve forgotten something\u2026\u201d\n\nNeville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got my Remembrall, Professor.\u201d\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\n\u201cJust looking,\u201d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\n\nAt three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked. \u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\n\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom,\u201d called Madam Hooch at the front, \u201cand say \u2018Up!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUP!\u201d everyone shouted.\n\nHarry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u2019d been doing it wrong for years.\n\n\u201cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle\u2014three\u2014two\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\u2019s lips.\n\n\u201cCome back, boy!\u201d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle\u2014twelve feet\u2014twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and\u2014\n\nWHAM\u2014a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n\n\u201cBroken wrist,\u201d Harry heard her mutter. \u201cCome on, boy\u2014it\u2019s all right, up you get.\u201d\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\n\u201cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\u2019ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \u2018Quidditch.\u2019 Come on, dear.\u201d\n\nNeville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n\n\u201cDid you see his face, the great lump?\u201d\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d snapped Parvati Patil.\n\n\u201cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\u201d said Pansy Parkinson, a hard faced Slytherin girl. \u201cNever thought you\u2019d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid thing Longbottom\u2019s gran sent him.\u201d\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\n\u201cGive that here, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find\u2014how about\u2014up a tree?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it here!\u201d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\u2019t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \u201cCome and get it, Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Hermione Granger. \u201cMadam Hooch told us not to move\u2014you\u2019ll get us all into trouble.\u201d\n\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\u2019d found something he could do without being taught\u2014this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d Harry called, \u201cor I\u2019ll knock you off that broom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\n\u201cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\u201d Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\u201cCatch it if you can, then!\u201d he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\u2014next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\u2014wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching\u2014he stretched out his hand\u2014a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\n\u201cHARRY POTTER!\u201d\n\nHis heart sank faster than he\u2019d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\n\u201cNever\u2014in all my time at Hogwarts\u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \u201c\u2014how dare you\u2014might have broken your neck\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault, Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Miss Patil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Malfoy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\u201d\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u2019s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\u2019s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted two weeks. He\u2019d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\u201d\n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who came out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking confused.\n\n\u201cFollow me, you two,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n\n\u201cIn here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n\n\u201cOut, Peeves!\u201d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n\n\u201cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood\u2014I\u2019ve found you a Seeker.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n\n\u201cAre you serious, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cThe boy\u2019s a natural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\n\n\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,\u201d Professor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n\n\u201cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\u201d he asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cWood\u2019s captain of the Gryffindor team,\u201d Professor McGonagall explained.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the build for a Seeker, too,\u201d said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \u201cLight\u2014speedy\u2014we\u2019ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor\u2014a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u2019t bend the first year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks\u2026\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n\n\u201cI want to hear you\u2019re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\u201d\n\nThen she suddenly smiled.\n\n\u201cYour father would have been proud,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all about it.\n\n\u201cSeeker?\u201d he said. \u201cBut first years never\u2014you must be the youngest house player in about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014a century,\u201d said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \u201cWood told me.\u201d\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n\n\u201cI start training next week,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnly don\u2019t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said George in a low voice. \u201cWood told us. We\u2019re on the team too\u2014Beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, we\u2019re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won since Charlie left, but this year\u2019s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u2019s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet it\u2019s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\u201d\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot braver now that you\u2019re back on the ground and you\u2019ve got your little friends with you,\u201d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take you on anytime on my own,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cTonight, if you want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only\u2014no contact. What\u2019s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Ron, wheeling around. \u201cI\u2019m his second, who\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n\n\u201cCrabbe,\u201d he said. \u201cMidnight all right? We\u2019ll meet you in the trophy room; that\u2019s always unlocked.\u201d\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \u201cWhat is a wizard\u2019s duel?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd what do you mean, you\u2019re my second?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u201d said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u2019s face, he added quickly, \u201cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\u201d Ron suggested.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t a person eat in peace in this place?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you could,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201c\u2014and you mustn\u2019t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if you\u2019re caught, and you\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very selfish of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Ron.\n\nAll the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u2019t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \u201cIf he tries to curse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t remember how to block them.\u201d There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness\u2014this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face to face. He couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\n\u201cHalf past eleven,\u201d Ron muttered at last, \u201cwe\u2019d better go.\u201d\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to do this, Harry.\u201d\n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cGo back to bed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost told your brother,\u201d Hermione snapped, \u201cPercy\u2014he\u2019s a prefect, he\u2019d put a stop to this.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n\nHermione wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\u2019t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\u2019ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\u2019re on the train home tomorrow, you\u2019re so\u2014\u201d\n\nBut what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\n\n\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d she asked shrilly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\nThey hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\u2019ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve\u2014\u201d said Ron loudly.\n\n\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cI heard something.\u201d\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n\n\u201cMrs. Norris?\u201d breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n\n\u201cThank goodness you found me! I\u2019ve been out here for hours, I couldn\u2019t remember the new password to get in to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\u2019s \u2018Pig snout\u2019 but it won\u2019t help you now, the Fat Lady\u2019s gone off somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Neville, showing them. \u201cMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u2014well, look, Neville, we\u2019ve got to be somewhere, we\u2019ll see you later\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u2019s been past twice already.\u201d\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\n\n\u201cIf either of you get us caught, I\u2019ll never rest until I\u2019ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\u201d\n\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn\u2019t Malfoy.\n\n\u201cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\u201d\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\u2019s voice. Neville\u2019s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in here somewhere,\u201d they heard him mutter, \u201cprobably hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following\u2014they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going\u2014they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n\n\u201cI\u2014told\u2014you,\u201d Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \u201cI\u2014told\u2014you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\u201d said Ron, \u201cquickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy tricked you,\u201d Hermione said to Harry. \u201cYou realize that, don\u2019t you? He was never going to meet you\u2014Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\u201d\n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. They hadn\u2019t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n\n\u201cShut up, Peeves\u2014please\u2014you\u2019ll get us thrown out.\u201d\n\nPeeves cackled.\n\n\u201cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\u2019ll get caughty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t give us away, Peeves, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould tell Filch, I should,\u201d said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\n\n\u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\u201d Peeves bellowed, \u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\u2014\u201d\n\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door\u2014and it was locked.\n\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \u201cWe\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u201d They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\u2019s shouts.\n\n\u201cOh, move over,\u201d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u2019s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \u201cAlohomora!\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open\u2014they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\n\u201cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\u201d Filch was saying. \u201cQuick, tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cShan\u2019t say nothing if you don\u2019t say please,\u201d said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing if you didn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u201d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\n\u201cHe thinks this door is locked,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay\u2014get off, Neville!\u201d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u2019s bathrobe for the last minute. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry turned around\u2014and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\u2019d walked into a nightmare\u2014this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\n\nThey weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob\u2014between Filch and death, he\u2019d take Filch.\n\nThey fell backward\u2014Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\u2019t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared\u2014all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\n\u201cWhere on earth have you all been?\u201d she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\n\u201cNever mind that\u2014pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\u2019d never speak again.\n\n\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\u201d\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \u201cYou don\u2019t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\u201d she snapped. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what it was standing on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe floor?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s obviously guarding something.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\u2014or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think we dragged her along, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something\u2026 What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide\u2014except perhaps Hogwarts.\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. HALLOWEEN\n\n\n\n\nMalfoy couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOr both,\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\u2019t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a broomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\u2019clock for your first training session.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\u201d Ron moaned enviously. \u201cI\u2019ve never even touched one.\u201d\n\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t resist it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry. \u201cComets look flashy, but they\u2019re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u2019t afford half the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back. \u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked.\n\n\u201cPotter\u2019s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said Malfoy quickly.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u201d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u201d he added.\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t stolen Neville\u2019s Remembrall I wouln\u2019t be on the team\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking rules?\u201d came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t stop now,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019s doing us so much good.\u201d\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\u2019s bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n\nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\u2019d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling\u2014he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\n\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what McGonagall meant\u2026 you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team practice three times a week.\u201d\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo\u2014that\u2019s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called the Keeper. I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air\u2014it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \u201cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u2019s why you have two Beaters on each team\u2014the Weasley twins are ours\u2014it\u2019s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So\u2014think you\u2019ve got all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\u201d Harry reeled off.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u201d Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\n\n\u201cNever at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014unless they crack my head open.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers\u2014I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\u201d\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the most important ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch because it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\u2014I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it\u2014any questions?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t practice with the Snitch yet,\u201d said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \u201cit\u2019s too dark, we might lose it. Let\u2019s try you out with a few of these.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u2019t carry on.\n\n\u201cThat Quidditch cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u201d said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing dragons.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\u2019d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\u2019s broomstick had arrived.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve been practicing!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too\u2014never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f\u2019 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\u201d\n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it\u2014Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n\nRon, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more luck.\n\n\u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it wrong,\u201d Harry heard Hermione snap. \u201cIt\u2019s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \u2018gar\u2019 nice and long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u201d Ron snarled.\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\n\n\u201cOh, well done!\u201d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \u201cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u201d\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u201d he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \u201cshe\u2019s a nightmare, honestly.\u201d\n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face\u2014and was startled to see that she was in tears.\n\n\u201cI think she heard you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \u201cShe must\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u201d\n\nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u2019 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u2019s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \u201cTroll\u2014in the dungeons\u2014thought you ought to know.\u201d\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence.\n\n\u201cPrefects,\u201d he rumbled, \u201clead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\u201d\n\nPercy was in his element.\n\n\u201cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could a troll get in?\u201d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\u201d\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought\u2014Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u201d\n\nRon bit his lip.\n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut Percy\u2019d better not see us.\u201d\n\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\u2019 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch me.\u201d\n\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\u2019s fading footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u201d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n\n\u201cCan you smell something?\u201d\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n\nAnd then they heard it\u2014a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed\u2014at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n\n\u201cThe keys in the lock,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could lock it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop\u2014a high, petrified scream\u2014and it was coming from the chamber they\u2019d just chained up.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d they said together.\n\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\n\n\u201cConfuse it!\u201d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n\n\u201cOy, pea brain!\u201d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u2019t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n\n\u201cCome on, run, run!\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\u2019s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his hand when he\u2019d jumped\u2014it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s nostrils.\n\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\u2014not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over\u2014and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\n\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\n\n\u201cIs it\u2014dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think it\u2019s just been knocked out.\u201d\n\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n\n\u201cUrgh\u2014troll boogers.\u201d\n\nHe wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers.\n\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\u2019t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u201d\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cPlease, Professor McGonagall\u2014they were looking for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n\n\u201cI went looking for the troll because I\u2014I thought I could deal with it on my own\u2014you know, because I\u2019ve read all about them.\u201d\n\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u2019t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u2019t new to them.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014in that case\u2026\u201d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \u201cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\u201d\n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you. If you\u2019re not hurt at all, you\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\u201d\n\nHermione left.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\u201d\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\n\n\u201cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\u201d Ron grumbled.\n\n\u201cFive, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u201d Ron admitted. \u201cMind you, we did save her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t locked the thing in with her,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n\n\u201cPig snout,\u201d they said and entered.\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d and hurried off to get plates.\n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n11. QUIDDITCH\n\n\n\n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\u2019t know which was worse\u2014people telling him he\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\n\n\u201cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,\u201d said Snape. \u201cGive it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just made that rule up,\u201d Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \u201cWonder what\u2019s wrong with his leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u201d said Ron bitterly.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\u2019s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\u201cHow will you learn?\u201d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.\n\n\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside\u2014and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\n\n\u201cBlasted thing,\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but\u2014\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\n\n\u201cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGET OUT! OUT!\u201d\n\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\n\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Ron asked as Harry joined them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\u2019d seen.\n\n\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d he finished breathlessly. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was going when we saw him\u2014he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! And I\u2019d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were wide.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not very nice, but he wouldn\u2019t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cI\u2019m with Harry. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past Snape. But what\u2019s he after? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u201d\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He tried to empty his mind\u2014he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours\u2014but the expression on Snape\u2019s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\u2019t easy to forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat some breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a bit of toast,\u201d wheedled Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\u2019s time he\u2019d be walking onto the field.\n\n\u201cHarry, you need your strength,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan. \u201cSeekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Seamus,\u201d said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.\n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\u201cOkay, men,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d Wood agreed. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big one,\u201d said Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cThe one we\u2019ve all been waiting for,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWe know Oliver\u2019s speech by heart,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cwe were on the team last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you two,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis is the best team Gryffindor\u2019s had in years. We\u2019re going to win. I know it.\u201d\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \u201cOr else.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. It\u2019s time. Good luck, all of you.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\u2019t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\n\n\u201cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\u201d she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\n\n\u201cMount your brooms, please.\u201d\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\n\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\n\n\u201cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor\u2014what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Professor.\u201d\n\nThe Weasley twins\u2019 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\u2019s, last year only a reserve\u2014back to Johnson and\u2014no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes\u2014Flint flying like an eagle up there\u2014he\u2019s going to sc\u2014no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle\u2014that\u2019s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and\u2014OUCH\u2014that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger\u2014Quaffle taken by the Slytherins\u2014that\u2019s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\u2019s blocked by a second Bludger\u2014sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\u2019t tell which\u2014nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes\u2014she\u2019s really flying\u2014dodges a speeding Bludger\u2014the goal posts are ahead\u2014come on, now, Angelina\u2014Keeper Bletchley dives\u2014misses\u2014GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\n\n\u201cBudge up there, move along.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\n\n\u201cBin watchin\u2019 from me hut,\u201d said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the same as bein\u2019 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had much to do yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKept outta trouble, though, that\u2019s somethin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\n\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\u2019s game plan.\n\n\u201cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\u201d Wood had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you attacked before you have to be.\u201d\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\u2019 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession,\u201d Lee Jordan was saying, \u201cChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the\u2014wait a moment\u2014was that the Snitch?\u201d\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs\u2014he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead\u2014he put on an extra spurt of speed\u2014\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below\u2014Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\u2019s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \u201cSend him off, ref! Red card!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cRed card!\u201d said Dean furiously. \u201cIn soccer you get shown the red card and you\u2019re out of the game!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t soccer, Dean,\u201d Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\u201d\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan!\u201d growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cI mean, after that open and revolting foul\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan, I\u2019m warning you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u201d\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts\u2014he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out\u2014and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession\u2014Flint with the Quaffle\u2014passes Spinnet\u2014passes Bell\u2014hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\u2014only joking, Professor\u2014Slytherins score\u2014A no\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\u201cDunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \u201cIf I didn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d lost control of his broom\u2026 but he can\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\u2019s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\n\n\u201cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\u201d Seamus whispered.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have,\u201d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \u201cCan\u2019t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic\u2014no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\u201d\n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\u2019s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d moaned Ron, gray faced.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Hermione gasped, \u201cSnape\u2014look.\u201d\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing something\u2014jinxing the broom,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good\u2014every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately.\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\u2019s robes.\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row\u2014Snape would never know what had happened.\n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\n\n\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes.\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick\u2014he hit the field on all fours\u2014coughed\u2014and something gold fell into his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u201d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\u201d Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference\u2014Harry hadn\u2019t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results\u2014Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt was Snape,\u201d Ron was explaining, \u201cHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \u201cWhy would Snape do somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\n\n\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d he told Hagrid. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\n\n\u201cHow do you know about Fluffy?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFluffy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014he\u2019s mine\u2014bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\u2019 year\u2014I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t ask me anymore,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cThat\u2019s top secret, that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Snape\u2019s trying to steal it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cSnape\u2019s a Hogwarts teacher, he\u2019d do nothin\u2019 of the sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why did he just try to kill Harry?\u201d cried Hermione.\n\nThe afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.\n\n\u201cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\u2019ve read all about them! You\u2019ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\u2019t blinking at all, I saw him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u201d said Hagrid hotly. \u201cI don\u2019 know why Harry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh\u2014yer meddlin\u2019 in things that don\u2019 concern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019 you forget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor Dumbledore an\u2019 Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED\n\n\n\n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\n\n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted at home.\u201d\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\u2019d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s cold drawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose\u2014that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u201d\n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d\n\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\u201d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \u201cMalfoy was insultin\u2019 his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\u2019t more. Move along, all of you.\u201d\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s back, \u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll get him\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them both,\u201d said Harry, \u201cMalfoy and Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cTell yeh what, come with me an\u2019 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\u201d\n\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\n\n\u201cAh, Hagrid, the last tree\u2014put it in the far corner, would you?\u201d\n\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\n\n\u201cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\u201d Hagrid asked.\n\n\u201cJust one,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd that reminds me\u2014Harry, Ron, we\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\n\n\u201cThe library?\u201d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \u201cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re not working,\u201d Harry told him brightly. \u201cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been trying to find out who he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Hagrid looked shocked. \u201cListen here\u2014I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that dog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u201d Harry added. \u201cWe must\u2019ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\u2019t find him anywhere\u2014just give us a hint\u2014I know I\u2019ve read his name somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid flatly.\n\n\u201cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\u201d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on\u2014out!\u201d\n\nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\n\n\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork\u2014bread, English muffins, marshmallows\u2014and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family\u2014in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \u201cDon\u2019t send me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWill you look at this? I\u2019ve got some presents!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect, turnips?\u201d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s.\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it\u2014it sounded a bit like an owl.\n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.\n\n\n\nTaped to the note was a fifty pence piece.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s friendly,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n\n\u201cWeird!\u201d he said, \u201cWhat a shape! This is money?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \u201cHagrid and my aunt and uncle\u2014so who sent these?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u201d said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \u201cMy mom. I told her you didn\u2019t expect any presents and\u2014oh, no,\u201d he groaned, \u201cshe\u2019s made you a Weasley sweater.\u201d\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n\n\u201cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\u201d said Ron, unwrapping his own, \u201cand mine\u2019s always maroon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of her,\u201d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.\n\nHis next present also contained candy\u2014a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\n\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\u2019d gotten from Hermione. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is\u2014they\u2019re really rare, and really valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is\u2014try it on.\u201d\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n\n\u201cIt is! Look down!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a note!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cA note fell out of it!\u201d\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n\nYour father left this in my possession before he died.\n\nIt is time it was returned to you.\n\nUse it well.\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\n\n\n\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give anything for one of these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, look\u2014Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred, holding up Harry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re not family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George demanded. \u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u201d George observed. \u201cI suppose she thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid\u2014we know we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise.\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n\n\u201cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t\u2014want,\u201d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\u201d said George. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d\n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce\u2014and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\u2019s Christmas dinner.\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much.\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge.\n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.\n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n\nHis father\u2019s\u2026 this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\n\nUse it well.\n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.\n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\u2014his father\u2019s cloak\u2014he felt that this time\u2014the first time\u2014he wanted to use it alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.\n\nThe library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence\u2014the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside\u2014stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\u2019t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\n\n\u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library Restricted Section.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \u201cThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him\u2014the cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid.\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket\u2014but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed\u2014for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder\u2014but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\u2019s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air\u2014she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes\u2014her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green\u2014exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\u2019s did.\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees\u2014Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face, whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried from the room.\n\n\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly.\n\n\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\u2019t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou look odd.\u201d\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m freezing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s forget it and go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Harry hissed. I know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here\u2014just here\u2014yes!\u201d\n\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\n\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! Look at them all\u2026 there are loads of them\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u201d\n\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\u2019t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\n\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCan you see all your family standing around you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m alone\u2014but I\u2019m different\u2014I look older\u2014and I\u2019m head boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am\u2014I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to\u2014and I\u2019m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup\u2014I\u2019m Quidditch captain, too.\u201d\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can it? All my family are dead\u2014let me have another look\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\u2019s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me\u2014\u201d\n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\u2019t realized how loudly they had been talking.\n\n\u201cQuick!\u201d\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing\u2014did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe\u2014she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\u201d\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\n\nThe snow still hadn\u2019t melted the next morning.\n\n\u201cWant to play chess, Harry?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go down and visit Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 you go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\u2019t go back tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it\u2014and anyway, you\u2019ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\u2019t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Harry, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\u2019t going to stop him.\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\u2019t meet anyone.\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\n\nExcept\u2014\n\n\u201cSo\u2014back again, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him.\n\n\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \u201cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I expect you\u2019ve realized by now what it does?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2014well\u2014it shows me my family\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\u201d\n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \u201cIt shows us what we want\u2026 whatever we want\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\n\n\u201cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\u201d\n\nHarry stood up.\n\n\u201cSir\u2014Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cOne can never have enough socks,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnother Christmas has come and gone and I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\u201d\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n\n\n\n\n\n13. NICOLAS FLAMEL\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\u2019d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\u201d said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\u201cIf Filch had caught you!\u201d), and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\u2019d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\n\n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an excuse to pick on us.\u201d\n\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\u2026\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me for a moment,\u201d said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \u201cI need to concen\u2014\u201d He caught sight of Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You look terrible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\u2019s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play,\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re ill,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cPretend to break your leg,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cReally break your leg,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u2019s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\u2019s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d said Neville shakily. \u201cI met him outside the library. He said he\u2019d been looking for someone to practice that on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Professor McGonagall!\u201d Hermione urged Neville. \u201cReport him!\u201d\n\nNeville shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want more trouble,\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s used to walking all over people, but that\u2019s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to tell me I\u2019m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s already done that,\u201d Neville choked out.\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worth twelve of Malfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\u2019t it? And where\u2019s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n\n\u201cThanks, Harry\u2026 I think I\u2019ll go to bed\u2026 D\u2019you want the card, you collect them, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n\n\u201cDumbledore again,\u201d he said, \u201cHe was the first one I ever\u2014\u201d\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found him!\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve found Flamel! I told you I\u2019d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here\u2014listen to this: \u2018Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u2019!\u201d\n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u2019t looked so excited since they\u2019d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n\n\u201cStay there!\u201d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\u2019 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\n\u201cI never thought to look in here!\u201d she whispered excitedly. \u201cI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cLight?\u201d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\u2019d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we allowed to speak yet?\u201d said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cNicolas Flamel,\u201d she whispered dramatically, \u201cis the only known maker of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone!\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t have quite the effect she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, honestly, don\u2019t you two read? Look\u2014read that, there.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\n\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).\n\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \u201cThe dog must be guarding Flamel\u2019s Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\u2019re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\u2019s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\u201cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo wonder Snape\u2019s after it! Anyone would want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no wonder we couldn\u2019t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly recent if he\u2019s six hundred and sixty five, is he?\u201d\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\u2019d do with a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone if they had one. It wasn\u2019t until Ron said he\u2019d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, all the Slytherins will think I\u2019m just too scared to face Snape. I\u2019ll show them\u2026 it\u2019ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as long as we\u2019re not wiping you off the field,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\u2019t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\u2019d found out about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone? Harry didn\u2019t see how he could\u2014yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\n\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\u2019d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker Curse. They\u2019d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s Locomotor Mortis,\u201d Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ron snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t nag.\u201d\n\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\u2019s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s out there!\u201d said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \u201cEven\u2014blimey\u2014Dumbledore\u2019s come to watch!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart did a somersault.\n\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief\u2014He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Snape look so mean,\u201d he told Hermione. \u201cLook they\u2019re off\u2014Ouch!\u201d\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cWonder how long Potter\u2019s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\n\u201cYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\u201d said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \u201cIt\u2019s people they feel sorry for. See, there\u2019s Potter, who\u2019s got no parents, then there\u2019s the Weasleys, who\u2019ve got no money\u2014you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\u2019ve got no brains.\u201d\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\u201d he stammered.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \u201cYou tell him, Neville.\u201d\n\n\u201cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\u2019d be poorer than Weasley, and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Malfoy\u2014one more word\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione suddenly, \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u2019s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\u201d said Malfoy.\n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape\u2014she didn\u2019t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches\u2014the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\n\u201cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\u2019s over! Harry\u2019s won! We\u2019ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\u201d shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d done it\u2014the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped\u2014then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\u2019s smiling face.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \u201cNice to see you haven\u2019t been brooding about that mirror\u2026 been keeping busy\u2026 excellent\u2026\u201d\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\u2019t ever remember feeling happier. He\u2019d really done something to be proud of now\u2014no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d shown Snape\u2026\n\nAnd speaking of Snape\u2026\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\u2019s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\u2019s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\u2014what was going on?\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\u2019t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\n\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\u2019t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u2019t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2026d-don\u2019t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I thought we\u2019d keep this private,\u201d said Snape, his voice icy. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, after all.\u201d\n\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\u2019s yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cB-b-but Severus, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\u201d said Snape, taking a step toward him.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\u201d\n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \u201c\u2014your little bit of hocus pocus. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cB-but I d-d-don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Snape cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another little chat soon, when you\u2019ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry, where have you been?\u201d Hermione squeaked.\n\n\u201cWe won! You won! We won!\u201d shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \u201cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He\u2019s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\u2019ll be all right\u2014talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\u2019s waiting for you in the common room, we\u2019re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that now,\u201d said Harry breathlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s find an empty room, you wait \u2019til you hear this\u2026\u201d\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\u2019t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\u2019d seen and heard.\n\n\u201cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, and Snape\u2019s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy\u2014and he said something about Quirrell\u2019s \u2018hocus pocus\u2019\u2014I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you mean the Stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\u201d said Hermione in alarm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\n\n\n14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\n\n\n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\u2019d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter.\n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\u2019t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\n\n\u201cHermione, the exams are ages away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen weeks,\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s not ages, that\u2019s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not six hundred years old,\u201d Ron reminded her. \u201cAnyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\u2019s an A.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\u2019re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me\u2026\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\u2019t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never remember this,\u201d Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\u2019d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\n\nHarry, who was looking up \u201cDittany\u201d in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\u2019t look up until he heard Ron say, \u201cHagrid! What are you doing in the library?\u201d\n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 lookin\u2019,\u201d he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \u201cAn\u2019 what\u2019re you lot up ter?\u201d He looked suddenly suspicious. \u201cYer not still lookin\u2019 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\u201d said Ron impressively. \u201cAnd we know what that dog\u2019s guarding, it\u2019s a Sorcerer\u2019s St\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \u201cDon\u2019 go shoutin\u2019 about it, what\u2019s the matter with yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\u201d said Harry, \u201cabout what\u2019s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHHHH!\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cListen\u2014come an\u2019 see me later, I\u2019m not promisin\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh anythin\u2019, mind, but don\u2019 go rabbitin\u2019 about it in here, students aren\u2019 s\u2019pposed ter know. They\u2019ll think I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you later, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid shuffled off.\n\n\u201cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see what section he was in,\u201d said Ron, who\u2019d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.\n\n\u201cDragons!\u201d he whispered. \u201cHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\u2019s Guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s against our laws,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\u2019 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\u2019s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\u2019re keeping dragons in the back garden\u2014anyway, you can\u2019t tame dragons, it\u2019s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\u2019s got off wild ones in Romania.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t wild dragons in Britain?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOf course there are,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\u2019ve spotted them, to make them forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what on earths Hagrid up to?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\u2019s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \u201cWho is it?\u201d before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014yeh wanted to ask me somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \u201cWe were wondering if you could tell us what\u2019s guarding the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone apart from Fluffy.\u201d\n\nHagrid frowned at him.\n\n\u201cO\u2019 course I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019 know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\u2019 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\u2019s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts\u2014I s\u2019ppose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\u201d said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\u2019s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \u201cWe only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 s\u2019pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 he borrowed Fluffy from me\u2026 then some o\u2019 the teachers did enchantments\u2026 Professor Sprout\u2014Professor Flitwick\u2014Professor McGonagall\u2014\u201d he ticked them off on his fingers, \u201cProfessor Quirrell\u2014an\u2019 Dumbledore himself did somethin\u2019, o\u2019 course. Hang on, I\u2019ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014yer not still on abou\u2019 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\u2019s not about ter steal it.\u201d\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything\u2014except, it seemed, Quirrell\u2019s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren\u2019t you, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry anxiously. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a soul knows except me an\u2019 Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid proudly.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d Harry muttered to the others. \u201cHagrid, can we have a window open? I\u2019m boiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \u201cThat\u2019s er\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \u201cIt must\u2019ve cost you a fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLas\u2019 night. I was down in the village havin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you going to do with it when it\u2019s hatched?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bin doin\u2019 some readin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \u201cGot this outta the library\u2014Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit\u2014it\u2019s a bit outta date, o\u2019 course, but it\u2019s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019 see here\u2014how ter recognize diff\u2019rent eggs\u2014what I got there\u2019s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\u2019re rare, them.\u201d\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n\n\u201cWonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u201d Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\u2019s hatching.\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lessons, we\u2019ll get into trouble, and that\u2019s nothing to what Hagrid\u2019s going to be in when someone finds out what he\u2019s doing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Harry whispered.\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\u2019t like the look on Malfoy\u2019s face at all.\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\u2019s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly out.\u201d He ushered them inside.\n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\u2019t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n\n\u201cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\u201d\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\u2014he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains\u2014it\u2019s a kid\u2014he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u201d\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\u2019s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\n\u201cJust let him go,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cSet him free.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHe\u2019s too little. He\u2019d die.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u201d said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \u201cHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry loudly, \u201cgive it two weeks and Norbert\u2019s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\u201d\n\nHagrid bit his lip.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I know I can\u2019t keep him forever, but I can\u2019t jus\u2019 dump him, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \u201cCharlie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m Ron, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014Charlie\u2014your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow about it, Hagrid?\u201d\n\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.\n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\n\n\u201cIt bit me!\u201d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\u201d\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hedwig!\u201d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \u201cShe\u2019ll have Charlie\u2019s answer!\u201d\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter\u2014I\u2019d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\u2019t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\u2019t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\u2019s still dark.\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\n\nLove,\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too difficult\u2014I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert\u2014and Malfoy.\n\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey\u2014would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were poisonous.\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just my hand,\u201d he whispered, \u201calthough that feels like it\u2019s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me\u2014I\u2019ve told her it was a dog, but I don\u2019t think she believes me. I shouldn\u2019t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\u201d said Hermione, but this didn\u2019t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\n\n\u201cMidnight on Saturday!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cOh no\u2014oh no\u2014I\u2019ve just remembered\u2014Charlie\u2019s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\u2019s going to know we\u2019re getting rid of Norbert.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione didn\u2019t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change the plan now,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\u2019ll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you in,\u201d he puffed. \u201cNorbert\u2019s at a tricky stage\u2014nothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n\nWhen they told him about Charlie\u2019s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\n\u201cAargh! It\u2019s all right, he only got my boot\u2014jus\u2019 playin\u2019\u2014he\u2019s only a baby, after all.\u201d\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\u2019t come quickly enough.\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn\u2019t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\u2019s hut because they\u2019d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\u2019d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got lots o\u2019 rats an\u2019 some brandy fer the journey,\u201d said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\u201d\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\n\u201cBye bye, Norbert!\u201d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \u201cMommy will never forget you!\u201d\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another\u2014even one of Harry\u2019s shortcuts didn\u2019t make the work much easier.\n\n\u201cNearly there!\u201d Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\n\u201cDetention!\u201d she shouted. \u201cAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\u2019s coming\u2014he\u2019s got a dragon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on\u2014I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\u201d\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\u2019d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got detention! I could sing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.\n\nCharlie\u2019s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\u2019d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going\u2026 going\u2026 gone.\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon\u2014Malfoy in detention\u2014what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n\n\n\n\nThings couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\u2019t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \u201cI was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\n\n\u201cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\u2019s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\u201d\n\nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville\u2014Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFour students out of bed in one night! I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions\u2014yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\u2019s very dangerous\u2014and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty?\u201d Harry gasped\u2014they would lose the lead, the lead he\u2019d won in the last Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cFifty points each,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\n\n\u201cProfessor\u2014please\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\u201d\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\u2019d done?\n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \u201cThanks, Potter, we owe you one!\u201d\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\u2019ve been here, and people still like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\u201d said Harry miserably.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014no,\u201d Ron admitted.\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t his business from now on. He\u2019d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\n\n\u201cResign?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat good\u2019ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\u2019t win at Quidditch?\u201d\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \u201cthe Seeker.\u201d\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as well known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions\u2026\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014not again, please\u2014\u201d\n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014all right\u2014\u201d he heard Quirrell sob.\n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\u2019d promised himself about not meddling.\n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step\u2014Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s done it, then!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf Quirrell\u2019s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still Fluffy, though,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cMaybe Snape\u2019s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\u201d said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \u201cI bet there\u2019s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\u201d\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\n\n\u201cGo to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got no proof!\u201d said Harry. \u201cQuirrell\u2019s too scared to back us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he doesn\u2019t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor\u2014who do you think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\u2019ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life depended on it, he\u2019s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\u2019ll think. And don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u201d\n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf we just do a bit of poking around\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly, \u201cwe\u2019ve done enough poking around.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.\n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven o\u2019clock tonight.\n\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\u2019t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\u2019d got.\n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock that night, they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\u2014and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\n\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\u2019t you, eh?\u201d he said, leering at them. \u201cOh yes\u2026 hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me\u2026 It\u2019s just a pity they let the old punishments die out\u2026 hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\u2019ve got the chains still in my office, keep \u2019em well oiled in case they\u2019re ever needed\u2026 Right, off we go, and don\u2019t think of running off, now, it\u2019ll be worse for you if you do.\u201d\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding so delighted.\n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \u201cI suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy\u2014it\u2019s into the forest you\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one piece.\u201d\n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n\u201cThe forest?\u201d he repeated, and he didn\u2019t sound quite as cool as usual. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there at night\u2014there\u2019s all sorts of things in there\u2014werewolves, I heard.\u201d\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\u2019s robe and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \u201cShould\u2019ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cAbou\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI bin waitin\u2019 fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\u201d said Filch coldly, \u201cthey\u2019re here to be punished, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yer late, is it?\u201d said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \u201cBin lecturin\u2019 them, eh? \u2019Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\u2019ve done yer bit, I\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back at dawn,\u201d said Filch, \u201cfor what\u2019s left of them,\u201d he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in that forest,\u201d he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\n\n\u201cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\u201d said Hagrid fiercely. \u201cYeh\u2019ve done wrong an\u2019 now yeh\u2019ve got ter pay fer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is servant stuff, it\u2019s not for students to do. I thought we\u2019d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014tell yer that\u2019s how it is at Hogwarts,\u201d Hagrid growled. \u201cCopyin\u2019 lines! What good\u2019s that ter anyone? Yeh\u2019ll do summat useful or yeh\u2019ll get out. If yeh think yer father\u2019d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\u2019 pack. Go on.\u201d\n\nMalfoy didn\u2019t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cnow, listen carefully, \u2019cause it\u2019s dangerous what we\u2019re gonna do tonight, an\u2019 I don\u2019 want no one takin\u2019 risks. Follow me over here a moment.\u201d\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\n\n\u201cLook there,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201csee that stuff shinin\u2019 on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\u2019s unicorn blood. There\u2019s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\u201d said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 that lives in the forest that\u2019ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\u2019re gonna split inter two parties an\u2019 follow the trail in diff\u2019rent directions. There\u2019s blood all over the place, it must\u2019ve bin staggerin\u2019 around since last night at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want Fang,\u201d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\u2019s long teeth.\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\u2019s a coward,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cSo me, Harry, an\u2019 Hermione\u2019ll go one way an\u2019 Draco, Neville, an\u2019 Fang\u2019ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\u2019ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\u2019 practice now\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014an\u2019 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\u2019 we\u2019ll all come an\u2019 find yeh\u2014so, be careful\u2014let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves.\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n\n\u201cCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cNot fast enough,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\u201d\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Hermione?\u201d Hagrid whispered. \u201cDon\u2019 worry, it can\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt, an\u2019 then we\u2019ll be able ter\u2014GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s summat in here that shouldn\u2019 be.\u201d\n\n\u201cA werewolf?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019 no werewolf an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 no unicorn, neither,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cRight, follow me, but careful, now.\u201d\n\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Hagrid called. \u201cShow yerself\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nAnd into the clearing came\u2014was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\u2019s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\u2019s jaws dropped.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid in relief. \u201cHow are yeh?\u201d\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\u201d said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \u201cWere you going to shoot me?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \u201cThere\u2019s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\u2019 Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\u2019 this is Ronan, you two. He\u2019s a centaur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d noticed,\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d said Hermione timidly.\n\n\u201cA bit. Well, that\u2019s something.\u201d Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \u201cMars is bright tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \u201cListen, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \u2019cause there\u2019s a unicorn bin hurt\u2014you seen anythin\u2019?\u201d\n\nRonan didn\u2019t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\n\n\u201cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut have yeh seen anythin\u2019, Ronan? Anythin\u2019 unusual?\u201d\n\n\u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \u201cUnusually bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I was meanin\u2019 anythin\u2019 unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \u201cSo yeh haven\u2019t noticed anythin\u2019 strange?\u201d\n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \u201cThe forest hides many secrets.\u201d\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.\n\n\u201cHullo, Bane,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell enough. Look, I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin askin\u2019 Ronan, you seen anythin\u2019 odd in here lately? There\u2019s a unicorn bin injured\u2014would yeh know anythin\u2019 about it?\u201d\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Hagrid grumpily. \u201cWell, if either of you do see anythin\u2019, let me know, won\u2019t yeh? We\u2019ll be off, then.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Hagrid irritably, \u201ctry an\u2019 get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\u2019 closer\u2019n the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many of them in here?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, a fair few\u2026 Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\u2019re good enough about turnin\u2019 up if ever I want a word. They\u2019re deep mind, centaurs\u2026 they know things\u2026 jus\u2019 don\u2019 let on much.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\u2019s bin killin\u2019 the unicorns\u2014never heard anythin\u2019 like it before.\u201d\n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two wait here!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cStay on the path, I\u2019ll come back for yeh!\u201d\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\u2019t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been hurt, do you?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Malfoy has, but if something\u2019s got Neville\u2026 it\u2019s our fault he\u2019s here in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two were makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups\u2014Neville, you stay with me an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019ll have a harder time frightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n\n\u201cLook\u2014\u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves.\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered\u2026 Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\u2019s side, and began to drink its blood.\n\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted\u2014so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry\u2014unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry\u2014he couldn\u2019t move for fear.\n\nThen a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and a palomino body.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014thank you\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time\u2014especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.\n\n\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\n\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you realize who this is?\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been telling him?\u201d growled Bane. \u201cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\u201d\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\u201d he said in his gloomy voice.\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\n\u201cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\u201d\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\n\u201cDo you not see that unicorn?\u201d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \u201cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u201d\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s Bane so angry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\u201d\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\u2019s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u201cWe\u2019ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed, \u201cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else\u2014something that will bring you back to full strength and power\u2014something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! Of course\u2014the Elixir of Life! But I don\u2019t understand who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u201d\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Harry croaked, \u201cthat was Vol\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\u201d\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \u201cThe unicorn\u2019s dead, Hagrid, it\u2019s in that clearing back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \u201cYou are safe now.\u201d\n\nHarry slid off his back.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry Potter,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\u201d\n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\n\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\n\u201cSnape wants the stone for Voldemort\u2026 and Voldemort\u2019s waiting in the forest\u2026 and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying the name!\u201d said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\u2019t have done so\u2026 Bane was furious\u2026 he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen\u2026 They must show that Voldemort\u2019s coming back\u2026 Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me\u2026 I suppose that\u2019s written in the stars as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you stop saying the name!\u201d Ron hissed.\n\n\u201cSo all I\u2019ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\u201d Harry went on feverishly, \u201cthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off\u2026 Well, I suppose Bane\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n\n\u201cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\u2019t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\u2019s a very imprecise branch of magic.\u201d\n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\u2019s surprises weren\u2019t over.\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\n\nJust in case.\n\n\n\n\n\n16. THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\n\n\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\u2014points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\n\nMaybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\u2019t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the rest.\n\n\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \u201cI needn\u2019t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u201d\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \u201cNo more studying,\u201d Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \u201cYou could look more cheerful, Harry, we\u2019ve got a week before we find out how badly we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\u201d\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew what this means!\u201d he burst out angrily. \u201cMy scar keeps hurting\u2014it\u2019s happened before, but never as often as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ill,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a warning\u2026 it means danger\u2019s coming\u2026\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t get worked up, it was too hot.\n\n\u201cHarry, relax, Hermione\u2019s right, the Stone\u2019s safe as long as Dumbledore\u2019s around. Anyway, we\u2019ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\u2019s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\u2019d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \u201cThat\u2019s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\u2019d done that one.\u201d\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\u2019t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy\u2026 never\u2026 but\u2026\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d said Ron sleepily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d said Harry. He had turned white. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \u201cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\u2019t answer.\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\u2019ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Hagrid casually, \u201che wouldn\u2019 take his cloak off.\u201d\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head\u2014that\u2019s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\u2019 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\u201d\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \u201cWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cMighta come up,\u201d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \u201cYeah\u2026 he asked what I did, an\u2019 I told him I was gamekeeper here\u2026 He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after\u2026 so I told him\u2026 an\u2019 I said what I\u2019d always really wanted was a dragon\u2026 an\u2019 then\u2026 I can\u2019 remember too well, \u2019cause he kept buyin\u2019 me drinks\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\u2019 we could play cards fer it if I wanted\u2026 but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home\u2026 So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did he\u2014did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u201d Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014yeah\u2014how many three headed dogs d\u2019yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a piece o\u2019 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\u2019 play him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll go straight off ter sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u201d he blurted out. \u201cForget I said it! Hey\u2014where\u2019re yeh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\u2019t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak\u2014it must\u2019ve been easy, once he\u2019d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\u2019t stop him. Where\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to\u2014\u201d Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you three doing inside?\u201d\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\n\u201cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\n\u201cSee Professor Dumbledore?\u201d Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed\u2014now what?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of secret,\u201d he said, but he wished at once he hadn\u2019t, because Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils flared.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \u201cProfessor\u2014it\u2019s about the Sorcerer\u2019s stone\u2014\u201d\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\u2019t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\u2019t pick them up. \u201cHow do you know ?\u201d she spluttered.\n\n\u201cProfessor, I think\u2014I know\u2014that Sn\u2014that someone\u2019s going to try and steal the Stone. I\u2019ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\u2019s too well protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \u201cI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \u201cSnape\u2019s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\u2019s found out everything he needs, and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what can we\u2014\u201d\n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n\nSnape was standing there.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said smoothly.\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this,\u201d he said, with an odd, twisted smile.\n\n\u201cWe were\u2014\u201d Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n\n\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHanging around like this, people will think you\u2019re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\u2019t afford to lose any more points, can it?\u201d\n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n\n\u201cBe warned, Potter\u2014any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\u201d\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n\n\u201cRight, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape\u2014wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\u201d He put on a high voice, \u201c\u2018Oh Professor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d better stay outside the third floor corridor,\u201d Harry told Ron. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nBut that part of the plan didn\u2019t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n\n\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\u201d she stormed. \u201cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\u2019ve come anywhere near here again, I\u2019ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \u201cAt least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u201d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry!\u201d she wailed. \u201cSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\u2019ve only just got away, I don\u2019t know where Snape went.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out of here tonight and I\u2019m going to try and get to the Stone first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAfter what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\u2019ll be expelled!\u201d\n\n\u201cSO WHAT?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\u2019s coming back! Haven\u2019t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\u2019t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter anymore, can\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side! I\u2019m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\u201d\n\nHe glared at them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Harry,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s just lucky I got it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it cover all three of us?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAll\u2014all three of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, you don\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione briskly. \u201cHow do you think you\u2019d get to the Stone without us? I\u2019d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\u2019re not throwing me out after that.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\u2019t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n\n\u201cBetter get the cloak,\u201d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy\u2014he didn\u2019t feel much like singing.\n\nHe ran back down to the common room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\u2014if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\u2019d been making another bid for freedom.\n\n\u201cNothing, Neville, nothing,\u201d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going out again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, Neville?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go out,\u201d said Neville, \u201cyou\u2019ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthis is important.\u201d\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you do it,\u201d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d Ron exploded, \u201cget away from that hole and don\u2019t be an idiot\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u201d said Neville. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but not to us,\u201d said Ron in exasperation. \u201cNeville, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.\n\n\u201cGo on then, try and hit me!\u201d said Neville, raising his fists. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cDo something,\u201d he said desperately.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u201d\n\nShe raised her wand.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n\nNeville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done to him?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the full Body Bind,\u201d said Hermione miserably. \u201cOh, Neville, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u201d said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\u2019s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u201d Ron whispered in Harry\u2019s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThey didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \u201cKnow you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u201d\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n\n\u201cShould call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a creeping around unseen.\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\u201d\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n\n\u201cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\u201d he said greasily. \u201cMy mistake, my mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t see you\u2014of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible\u2014forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have business here, Peeves,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cStay away from this place tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\u201d said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \u201cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u201d\n\nAnd he scooted off.\n\n\u201cBrilliant, Harry!\u201d whispered Ron.\n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridor\u2014and the door was already ajar.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d Harry said quietly, \u201cSnape\u2019s already got past Fluffy.\u201d\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can take the cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry pushed the door open.\n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that at its feet?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cLooks like a harp,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape must have left it there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, here goes\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\u2019s growls ceased\u2014it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n\n\u201cKeep playing,\u201d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\u2019s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u201d said Ron, peering over the dog\u2019s back. \u201cWant to go first, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n\n\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Hermione said anxiously.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2014just black\u2014there\u2019s no way of climbing down, we\u2019ll just have to drop.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\n\n\u201cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\u201d\n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cSee you in a minute, I hope\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and\u2014\n\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \u201cit\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u201d\n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff?\u201d were his first words.\n\n\u201cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\u201d\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\u2019s other side.\n\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLucky!\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cLook at you both!\u201d\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.\n\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what this is\u2014it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a great help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\n\n\u201cDevil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare\u2026 what did Professor Sprout say?\u2014it likes the dark and the damp\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo light a fire!\u201d Harry choked.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014of course\u2014but there\u2019s no wood!\u201d Hermione cried, wringing her hands.\n\n\u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u201d Ron bellowed. \u201cARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\n\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a crisis\u2014\u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully grown dragon\u2014Norbert had been bad enough\u2026\n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 sounds like wings to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead\u2014I can see something moving.\u201d\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once\u2026 well, there\u2019s no other choice\u2026 I\u2019ll run.\u201d\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThese birds\u2026 they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering\u2014glittering?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re keys! Winged keys\u2014look carefully. So that must mean\u2026\u201d he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \u201c\u2026yes\u2014look! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are hundreds of them!\u201d\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a big, old fashioned one\u2014probably silver, like the handle.\u201d\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\u2019t. After a minute\u2019s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\n\u201cThat one!\u201d he called to the others. \u201cThat big one\u2014there\u2014no, there\u2014with bright blue wings\u2014the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\u201d\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to close in on it!\u201d Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \u201cRon, you come at it from above\u2014Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\u2019ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\u201d\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned\u2014it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly\u2014the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way across the room.\u201d\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Hermione nervously.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to be chessmen.\u201d\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\u2019s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\u201cDo we\u2014er\u2014have to join you to get across?\u201d The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cThis needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\u2019ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not offended,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cJust tell us what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go next to him instead of that castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a knight,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n\n\u201cWhite always plays first in chess,\u201d said Ron, peering across the board. \u201cYes\u2026 look\u2026\u201d\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014move diagonally four squares to the right.\u201d\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.\n\n\u201cHad to let that happen,\u201d said Ron, looking shaken. \u201cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\u201d\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cLet me think\u2014let me think\u2026\u201d\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Ron softly, \u201cIt\u2019s the only way\u2026 I\u2019ve got to be taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s chess!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\u2019ll take me\u2014that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t hurry up, he\u2019ll already have the Stone!\u201d\n\nThere was no alternative.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Ron called, his face pale but determined. \u201cHere I go\u2014now, don\u2019t hang around once you\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor\u2014Hermione screamed but stayed on her square\u2014the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\u2019d been knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\u2019s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\n\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, trying to convince himself. \u201cWhat do you reckon\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare; Flitwick must\u2019ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThey had reached another door.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHarry pushed it open.\n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u201d Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \u201cCome on, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next\u2014but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\u2019t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\n\n\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\n\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n\n\n\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\u2019s left side;\n\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\n\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n\n\n\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n\n\n\n\n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis isn\u2019t magic\u2014it\u2019s logic\u2014a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t got an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be stuck in here forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut so will we, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cEverything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we know which to drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d\n\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fire\u2014toward the Stone.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough there for one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly one swallow.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\u201d\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n\n\u201cYou drink that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\u2019ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy\u2014go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\u2019m no match for him, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry\u2014what if You-Know-Who\u2019s with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I was lucky once, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry, pointing at his scar. \u201cI might get lucky again.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014you\u2019re a great wizard, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you,\u201d said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBooks! And cleverness! There are more important things\u2014friendship and bravery and\u2014oh Harry\u2014be careful!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou drink first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou are sure which is which, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poison?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014but it\u2019s like ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, go, before it wears off.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck\u2014take care.\u201d\n\n\u201cGO!\u201d\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\n\n\u201cHere I come,\u201d he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\u2019t feel them\u2014for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\u2014then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there\u2014but it wasn\u2019t Snape. It wasn\u2019t even Voldemort.\n\n\n\n\n\n17. THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\n\n\n\nIt was Quirrell.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\u2019t twitching at all.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI wondered whether I\u2019d be meeting you here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought\u2014Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus?\u201d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\u2019t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \u201cYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\u2019t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take it in. This couldn\u2019t be true, it couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut Snape tried to kill me!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\u2019d have got you off that broom. I\u2019d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\u2019t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape was trying to save me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Quirrell coolly. \u201cWhy do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t do it again. Funny, really\u2026 he needn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular\u2026 and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u201d\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\u2019d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let the troll in?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls\u2014you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off\u2014and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three headed dog didn\u2019t even manage to bite Snape\u2019s leg off properly.\n\n\u201cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\u201d\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\n\u201cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\u201d Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \u201cTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like this\u2026 but he\u2019s in London\u2026 I\u2019ll be far away by the time he gets back\u2026\u201d\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\n\n\u201cI saw you and Snape in the forest\u2014\u201d he blurted out.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \u201cHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\u2019d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me\u2014as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n\n\u201cI see the Stone\u2026 I\u2019m presenting it to my master\u2026 but where is it?\u201d\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\u2019t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\n\u201cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he does,\u201d said Quirrell casually, \u201cheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\u2019t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing\u2014I thought Snape was threatening you\u2026\u201d\n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI find it hard to follow my master\u2019s instructions\u2014he is a great wizard and I am weak\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHe is with me wherever I go,\u201d said Quirrell quietly. \u201cI met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it\u2026 Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\u201d Quirrell shivered suddenly. \u201cHe does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me\u2026 decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He\u2019d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mind was racing.\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it\u2014which means I\u2019ll see where it\u2019s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\u2019m up to?\n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\n\n\u201cUse the boy\u2026 Use the boy\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014Potter\u2014come here.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Quirrell repeated. \u201cLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nHarry walked toward him.\n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\u2019s all.\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket\u2014and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow\u2014incredibly\u2014he\u2019d gotten the Stone.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impatiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\nHarry screwed up his courage.\n\n\u201cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u201d he invented. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nQuirrell cursed again.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips.\n\n\u201cHe lies\u2026 He lies\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me the truth! What did you just see?\u201d\n\nThe high voice spoke again.\n\n\u201cLet me speak to him\u2026 face-to-face\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, you are not strong enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have strength enough\u2026 for this\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter\u2026\u201d it whispered.\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the face said. \u201cMere shadow and vapor\u2026 I have form only when I can share another\u2019s body\u2026 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds\u2026 Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks\u2026 you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest\u2026 and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own\u2026 Now\u2026 why don\u2019t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\u201d\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\u2019s legs. He stumbled backward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d snarled the face. \u201cBetter save your own life and join me\u2026 or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents\u2026 They died begging me for mercy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted suddenly.\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.\n\n\u201cHow touching\u2026\u201d it hissed. \u201cI always value bravery\u2026 Yes, boy, your parents were brave\u2026 I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight\u2026 but your mother needn\u2019t have died\u2026 she was trying to protect you\u2026 Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \u201cSEIZE HIM!\u201d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened\u2014he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers\u2014they were blistering before his eyes.\n\n\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\u2019s neck\u2014Harry\u2019s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\n\u201cMaster, I cannot hold him\u2014my hands\u2014my hands!\u201d\n\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms\u2014Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\n\u201cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\u201d screeched Voldemort.\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain\u2014his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off\u2014the pain in Harry\u2019s head was building\u2014he couldn\u2019t see\u2014he could only hear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s yells of, \u201cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d and other voices, maybe in Harry\u2019s own head, crying, \u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down\u2026 down\u2026 down\u2026\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\n\nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \u201cSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who does? Sir, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\n\u201cTokens from your friends and admirers,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have I been in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sit, the Stone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feared I might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou nearly were, I couldn\u2019t have kept him off the Stone much longer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Stone, boy, you\u2014the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cBut your friend\u2014Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know about Nicolas?\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \u201cYou did do the thing properly, didn\u2019t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cTo one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all\u2014the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\u201d\n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 sir\u2014even if the Stone\u2019s gone, Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\u2019s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he hasn\u2019t gone, has he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share\u2026 not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time\u2014and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \u201cSir, there are some other things I\u2019d like to know, if you can tell me\u2026 things I want to know the truth about\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d Dumbledore sighed. \u201cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\u2019ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\u201d\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n\n\u201cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day\u2026 put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older\u2026 I know you hate to hear this\u2026 when you are ready, you will know.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\u201cBut why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t realize that love as powerful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign\u2026 to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\u201d\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \u201cAnd the Invisibility Cloak\u2014do you know who sent it to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2014your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cUseful things\u2026 your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s something else\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFire away.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirrell said Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, him\u2014Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saved his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore dreamily. \u201cFunny, the way people\u2019s minds work, isn\u2019t it? Professor Snape couldn\u2019t bear being in your father\u2019s debt\u2026 I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\u2019s memory in peace\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\n\n\u201cAnd sir, there\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, now, I\u2019m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\u2019s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone\u2014find it, but not use it\u2014would be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes\u2026 Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve rather lost my liking for them\u2014but I think I\u2019ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \u201cAlas! Ear wax!\u201d\n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\n\n\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Harry pleaded.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let Professor Dumbledore in\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut five minutes only.\u201d\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to\u2014Dumbledore was so worried\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s talking about it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat really happened?\u201d\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\u2019s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\u201cSo the Stone\u2019s gone?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cFlamel\u2019s just going to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that\u2014what was it?\u2014\u2018to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI always said he was off his rocker,\u201d said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to you two?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I got back all right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI brought Ron round\u2014that took a while\u2014and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall\u2014he already knew\u2014he just said, \u2018Harry\u2019s gone after him, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019 and hurtled off to the third floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he meant you to do it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cSending you your father\u2019s cloak and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione exploded, \u201cif he did\u2014I mean to say that\u2019s terrible\u2014you could have been killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\u2019s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Dumbledore\u2019s off his rocker, all right,\u201d said Ron proudly. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course\u2014you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you\u2014but the food\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\u201d she said firmly.\n\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the feast,\u201d he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \u201cI can, can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\u201d she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\u2019t realize how risky feasts could be. \u201cAnd you have another visitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014all\u2014my\u2014ruddy\u2014fault!\u201d he sobbed, his face in his hands. \u201cI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\u2019t know, an\u2019 I told him! Yeh could\u2019ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\u2019ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\u2019 made ter live as a Muggle!\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \u201cHagrid, he\u2019d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\u2019re talking about, he\u2019d have found out even if you hadn\u2019t told him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh could\u2019ve died!\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 say the name!\u201d\n\n\u201cVOLDEMORT!\u201d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \u201cI\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\u2019ve got loads\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \u201cThat reminds me. I\u2019ve got yeh a present.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\u201d said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\n\n\u201cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \u2019Course, he shoulda sacked me instead\u2014anyway, got yeh this\u2026\u201d\n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\n\n\u201cSent owls off ter all yer parents\u2019 old school friends, askin\u2019 fer photos\u2026 knew yeh didn\u2019 have any\u2026 d\u2019yeh like it?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t speak, but Hagrid understood.\n\nHarry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\u2019s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\u2019s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\n\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u201cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were\u2026 you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts\u2026\n\n\u201cNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\u201d\n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, recent events must be taken into account.\u201d\n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little.\n\n\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes\u2026\n\n\u201cFirst\u2014to Mr. Ronald Weasley\u2026\u201d\n\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n\n\u201c\u2026for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \u201cMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\u2019s giant chess set!\u201d\n\nAt last there was silence again.\n\n\u201cSecond\u2014to Miss Hermione Granger\u2026 for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves\u2014they were a hundred points up.\n\n\u201cThird\u2014to Mr. Harry Potter\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet \u201c\u2026for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\u201d\n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points\u2014exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup\u2014if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of courage,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\u201d\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \u201cwe need a little change of decoration.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s feelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls\u2026 he would never, ever forget tonight.\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life.\n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us these,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross Station.\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\u2019t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\n\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron, \u201cboth of you\u2014I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look forward to.\u201d People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\n\n\u201cBye, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cStill famous,\u201d said Ron, grinning at him.\n\n\u201cNot where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \u201cThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!\u201d\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she wasn\u2019t pointing at Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook, Mom! I can see\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\n\u201cBusy year?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was nothing, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady, are you?\u201d\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou must be Harry\u2019s family!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cHurry up, boy, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d He walked away.\n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cSee you over the summer, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope you have\u2014er\u2014a good holiday,\u201d said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re not allowed to use magic at home. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J. K.

THE BOY WHO LIVED\n\n\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n\n\u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar\u2014a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen\u2014then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive\u2014no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes\u2014the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt\u2014these people were obviously collecting for something\u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes, their son, Harry\u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking\u2026 no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her\u2014if he\u2019d had a sister like that\u2026 but all the same, those people in cloaks\u2026\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\u2014and it didn\u2019t improve his mood\u2014was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\n\u201cAnd finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early\u2014it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters\u2026\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr\u2014Petunia, dear\u2014you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n\u201cWell, I just thought\u2026 maybe\u2026 it was something to do with\u2026 you know\u2026 her crowd.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son\u2014he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did\u2026 if it got out that they were related to a pair of\u2014well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind\u2026 He couldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on\u2014he yawned and turned over\u2014it couldn\u2019t affect them\u2026\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have known.\u201d\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\u2014the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\n\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n\u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no\u2014even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living room window. \u201cI heard it. Flocks of owls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 Well, they\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent\u2014I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\u201d\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u2018You-Know-Who\u2019 nonsense\u2014for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u2018You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you haven\u2019t\u201d, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re different. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You Know\u2014oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re too\u2014well\u2014noble to use them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying,\u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are\u2014are\u2014that they\u2019re\u2014dead.\u201d\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\u201cLily and James\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to believe it\u2026 Oh, Albus\u2026\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u201cI know\u2026 I know\u2026\u201d he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potter\u2019s son, Harry. But\u2014he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u2019s power somehow broke\u2014and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s true?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter all he\u2019s done\u2026 all the people he\u2019s killed\u2026 he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding\u2026 of all the things to stop him\u2026 but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may never know.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be here, by the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all places?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014you can\u2019t mean the people who live here?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore\u2014you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got this son\u2014I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous\u2014a legend\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future\u2014there will be books written about Harry\u2014every child in our world will know his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. \u201cIt would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes\u2014yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2014wise\u2014to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky\u2014and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild\u2014long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir\u2014house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\u201cIs that where\u2014?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that scar forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well\u2014give him here, Hagrid\u2014we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cCould I\u2014could I say good bye to him, sir?\u201d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the Muggles!\u201d\n\n\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-can\u2019t stand it\u2014Lily an\u2019 James dead\u2014an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be takin\u2019 Sirius his bike back. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall\u2014Professor Dumbledore, sir.\u201d\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\n\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley\u2026 He couldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Potter\u2014the boy who lived!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE VANISHING GLASS\n\n\n\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets\u2014but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s birthday\u2014how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise\u2014unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask questions\u2014that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way\u2014all over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\u2014Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\n\u201cThirty six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, thirty seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\u201d\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty\u2026 thirty\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction.\n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\u2019t there\u2014or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug.\n\n\u201cWhat about what\u2019s her name, your friend\u2014Yvonne?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon.\n\n\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she snarled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \u201c\u2026and leave him in the car\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone\u2026\u201d\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying\u2014it had been years since he\u2019d really cried\u2014but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 want\u2026 him\u2026 t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-spoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang\u2014\u201cOh, good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically\u2014and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy\u2014any funny business, anything at all\u2014and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls)\u2014The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\n\n\u201c\u2026roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \u201cMOTORCYCLES DON\u2019T FLY!\u201d\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon\u2014they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can\u2014but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself\u2014no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be really annoying.\u201d\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\n\n\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u201cOh, I see\u2014so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened\u2014one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come\u2026 Thanksss, amigo.\u201d\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo\u2014cupboard\u2014stay\u2014no meals,\u201d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\n\n\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n\n\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs and practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as horrible as your head down it\u2014it might be sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings\u2019 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing some of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High\u2014like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and\u2014a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives\u2014he didn\u2019t belong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\n\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\n\n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\n\n\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny whelk.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d said Dudley suddenly. \u201cDad, Harry\u2019s got something!\u201d\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness\u2014Vernon!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley.\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n\n\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u201clook at the address\u2014how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching\u2014spying\u2014might be following us,\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an answer\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s best\u2026 we won\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we swear when we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\u201d\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s writing to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my cupboard on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, Harry\u2014about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking\u2026 you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it\u2026 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\u2019d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there\u2026 I need that room\u2026 make him get out\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cGo to your cupboard\u2014I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he wheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley\u2014go\u2014just go.\u201d\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAAARRRGH!\u201d\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat\u2014something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\n\u201cI want\u2014\u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno damn letters today\u2014\u201d\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one\u2014\n\n\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u201d\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n\n\u201cShake \u2019em off\u2026 shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television programs he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering\u2026\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\n\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great Humberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u201d\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday\u2014and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television\u2014then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun\u2014last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.\n\n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! Everyone out!\u201d\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all aboard!\u201d\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds\u2026 twenty\u2026 ten\u2026 nine\u2014maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him\u2014three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\n\n\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \u201cWhere\u2019s the cannon?\u201d he said stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands\u2014now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then\u2014\n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy journey\u2026\u201d\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n\n\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\n\u201cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are breaking and entering!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n\n\u201cAnyway\u2014Harry,\u201d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here\u2014I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u201d\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u2019s whole arm.\n\n\u201cWhat about that tea then, eh?\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together. \u201cI\u2019d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\u2019ve got it, mind.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath.\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n\u201cYer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019 anymore, Dursley, don\u2019 worry.\u201d\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\n\u201cCall me Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone does. An\u2019 like I told yeh, I\u2019m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts\u2014yeh\u2019ll know all about Hogwarts, o\u2019 course.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014no,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said quickly.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019 s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\u2019t gettin\u2019 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\u2019t even know abou\u2019 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll what?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cALL WHAT?\u201d Hagrid thundered. \u201cNow wait jus\u2019 one second!\u201d\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n\u201cDo you mean ter tell me,\u201d he growled at the Dursleys, \u201cthat this boy\u2014this boy!\u2014knows nothin\u2019 abou\u2019\u2014about ANYTHING?\u201d\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u201cI know some things,\u201d he said. \u201cI can, you know, do math and stuff.\u201d But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \u201cAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u2019 world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\n\u201cDURSLEY!\u201d he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \u201cMimblewimble.\u201d Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n\n\u201cBut yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re famous. You\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? My\u2014my mom and dad weren\u2019t famous, were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know\u2026 yeh don\u2019 know\u2026\u201d Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know what yeh are?\u201d he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he commanded. \u201cStop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\u201d\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\n\n\u201cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\u2019 you\u2019ve kept it from him all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cKept what from me?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\u201cAh, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry\u2014yer a wizard.\u201d\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d gasped Harry.\n\n\u201cA wizard, o\u2019 course,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \u201can\u2019 a thumpin\u2019 good\u2019un, I\u2019d say, once yeh\u2019ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\u2019 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\u2019 I reckon it\u2019s abou\u2019 time yeh read yer letter.\u201d\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut on the Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\n\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\u2019s head like fireworks and he couldn\u2019t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \u201cWhat does it mean, they await my owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cGallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl\u2014a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl\u2014a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going,\u201d he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry, interested.\n\n\u201cA Muggle,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cit\u2019s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\u2019 it\u2019s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\u2019 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe swore when we took him in we\u2019d put a stop to that rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cswore we\u2019d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou knew I\u2019m a\u2014a wizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew!\u201d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \u201cKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that\u2014that school\u2014and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was\u2014a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\u201d\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n\n\u201cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\u2019d be just the same, just as strange, just as\u2014as\u2014abnormal\u2014and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\u201d\n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \u201cBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\u201d\n\n\u201cCAR CRASH!\u201d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \u201cHow could a car crash kill Lily an\u2019 James Potter? It\u2019s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\u2019 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why? What happened?\u201d Harry asked urgently.\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\u2019s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\n\n\u201cI never expected this,\u201d he said, in a low, worried voice. \u201cI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\u2019 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\u2019t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u2019 know if I\u2019m the right person ter tell yeh\u2014but someone\u2019s gotta\u2014yeh can\u2019t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh\u2014mind, I can\u2019t tell yeh everythin\u2019, it\u2019s a great myst\u2019ry, parts of it\u2026\u201d\n\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \u201cIt begins, I suppose, with\u2014with a person called\u2014but it\u2019s incredible yeh don\u2019t know his name, everyone in our world knows\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I don\u2019 like sayin\u2019 the name if I can help it. No one does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cGulpin\u2019 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went\u2026 bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\n\n\u201cCould you write it down?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cNah can\u2019t spell it. All right\u2014Voldemort.\u201d Hagrid shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again. Anyway, this\u2014this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\u2019 fer followers. Got \u2019em, too\u2014some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\u2019 his power, \u2019cause he was gettin\u2019 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\u2019t know who ter trust, didn\u2019t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches\u2026 terrible things happened. He was takin\u2019 over. \u2019Course, some stood up to him\u2014an\u2019 he killed \u2019em. Horribly. One o\u2019 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u2019t dare try takin\u2019 the school, not jus\u2019 then, anyway.\n\n\u201cNow, yer mum an\u2019 dad were as good a witch an\u2019 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\u2019 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\u2019ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get \u2019em on his side before\u2026 probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\u2019 ter do with the Dark Side.\n\n\u201cMaybe he thought he could persuade \u2019em\u2026 maybe he just wanted \u2019em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\u2019\u2014an\u2019\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s that sad\u2014knew yer mum an\u2019 dad, an\u2019 nicer people yeh couldn\u2019t find\u2014anyway\u2026\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who killed \u2019em. An\u2019 then\u2014an\u2019 this is the real myst\u2019ry of the thing\u2014he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\u2019 by then. But he couldn\u2019t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u2019s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh\u2014took care of yer mum an\u2019 dad an\u2019 yer house, even\u2014but it didn\u2019t work on you, an\u2019 that\u2019s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u2018em, no one except you, an\u2019 he\u2019d killed some o\u2019 the best witches an\u2019 wizards of the age\u2014the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts\u2014an\u2019 you was only a baby, an\u2019 you lived.\u201d\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u2019s mind. As Hagrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before\u2014and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\n\n\u201cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\u2019s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLoad of old tosh,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\n\n\u201cNow, you listen here, boy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cI accept there\u2019s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\u2019t have cured\u2014and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\u2019s better off without them in my opinion\u2014asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types\u2014just what I expected, always knew they\u2019d come to a sticky end\u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dursley\u2014I\u2019m warning you\u2014one more word\u2026\u201d\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\n\n\u201cBut what happened to Vol\u2014, sorry\u2014I mean, You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u2019s the biggest myst\u2019ry, see\u2026 he was gettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful\u2014why\u2019d he go?\n\n\u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\u2019s still out there, bidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. Don\u2019 reckon they could\u2019ve done if he was comin\u2019 back.\n\n\u201cMost of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause somethin\u2019 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he hadn\u2019t counted on\u2014I dunno what it was, no one does\u2014but somethin\u2019 about you stumped him, all right.\u201d\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time they\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI think you must have made a mistake. I don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\n\u201cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it\u2026 every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry\u2026 chased by Dudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach\u2026 dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow back\u2026 and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him?\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry Potter, not a wizard\u2014you wait, you\u2019ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a fight.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u201d he hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to Stonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish\u2014spell books and wands and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop him,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cStop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s son goin\u2019 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u2019s been down ever since he was born. He\u2019s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\u2019t know himself. He\u2019ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \u201cNEVER,\u201d he thundered, \u201c\u2014INSULT\u2014ALBUS\u2014DUMBLEDORE\u2014IN\u2014FRONT\u2014OF\u2014ME!\u201d\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\u2014there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\u2019s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019ta lost me temper,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\u2019t much left ter do.\u201d\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n\u201cBe grateful if yeh didn\u2019t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014er\u2014not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\u2019. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\u2019 get yer letters to yeh an\u2019 stuff\u2014one o\u2019 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you supposed to do magic?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, well\u2014I was at Hogwarts meself but I\u2014er\u2014got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\u2019 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and we\u2019ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\u201d said Hagrid loudly. \u201cGotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\u2019 that.\u201d\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou can kip under that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\u2019 dormice in one o\u2019 the pockets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. DIAGON ALLEY\n\n\n\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he told himself firmly. \u201cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard.\u201d\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s an owl\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPay him,\u201d Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets\u2014bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags\u2026 finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.\n\n\u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n\u201cKnuts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n\u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\n\n\u201cUm\u2014Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any money\u2014and you heard Uncle Vernon last night\u2026 he won\u2019t pay for me to go and learn magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \u201cD\u2019yeh think yer parents didn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if their house was destroyed\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a sausage, they\u2019re not bad cold\u2014an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no teh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cWizards have banks?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n\u201cGoblins?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe\u2014\u2019cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\u2019 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\u201d Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \u201cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\u2019 you gettin\u2019 things from Gringotts\u2014knows he can trust me, see.\n\n\u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n\n\u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cFlew?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter use magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\n\u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter\u2014er\u2014speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\n\u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cSpells\u2014enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way\u2014Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die of hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\u201d\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life.\n\n\u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u201d\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \u201cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \u201cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so they say,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCrikey, I\u2019d like a dragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted one ever since I was a kid\u2014here we go.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t understand \u201cMuggle money,\u201d as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\n\n\u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s a list there of everything yeh need.\u201d\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t noticed the night before, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\nFirst year students will require:\n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\n\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\n\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\n\n4.

Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual, Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees buckle.\n\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis this\u2014can this be ?\u201d\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n\u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry Potter\u2026 what an honor.\u201d\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n\u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand\u2014I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\u201d Harry shook hands again and again\u2014Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\n\u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d He laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\u201d He looked terrified at the very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\n\u201cMust get on\u2014lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n\u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh\u2014mind you, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience\u2026 They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag\u2014never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\n\u201cThree up\u2026 two across,\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight, stand back, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered\u2014it wriggled\u2014in the middle, a small hole appeared\u2014it grew wider and wider\u2014a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\nHe grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons\u2014All Sizes\u2014Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver\u2014Self Stirring\u2014Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we gotta get yer money first.\u201d\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u201cDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad\u2026\u201d\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium\u2014Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of them say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand\u2014fastest ever\u2014\u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon\u2026\n\n\u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was\u2014\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\n\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\n\n\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours,\n\nThief, you have been warned, beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike I said, Yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u201d\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u201d\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More \u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in\u2014Hagrid with some difficulty\u2014and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late\u2014they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d\n\n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry\u2019s\u2014it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n\n\u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said Griphook.\n\n\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least\u2014but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\u2019d had in his whole life\u2014more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n\n\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to speak. \u201cGot the lot here\u2014another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u201d\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n\u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n\n\u201cI do\u2014Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been\u2014imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n\n\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\n\n\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage\u2014lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the drawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know\u2014not knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s.\n\n\u201c\u2014and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were\u2014he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\u2019 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in \u2019em in a long line o\u2019 Muggles\u2014look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like\u2014like soccer in the Muggle world\u2014everyone follows Quidditch\u2014played up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls\u2014sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\n\u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d\n\n\u201cVol\u2014sorry\u2014You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\n\n\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of the curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d\n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again.\n\n\u201cJust yer wand left\u2014A yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birthday present.\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at\u2014an\u2019 I don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander\u2019s left now\u2014only place fer wands, Ollivander\u2019s, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d\n\nA magic wand\u2026 this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it\u2014it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead with a long, white finger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands\u2026 well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the world to do\u2026\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again\u2026 Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added brightly.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \u201cWell, now\u2014Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014well, I\u2019m right handed,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n\n\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried\u2014but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n\n\u201cNo, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match here somewhere\u2014I wonder, now\u2014yes, why not\u2014unusual combination\u2014holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well\u2026 how curious\u2026 how very curious\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious\u2026 curious\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather\u2014just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it\u2019s brother\u2014why, it\u2019s brother gave you that scar.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n\u201cYes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember\u2026 I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter\u2026 After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things\u2014terrible, yes, but great.\u201d\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best birthday of his life\u2014and yet\u2014he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander\u2026 but I don\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m famous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol\u2014sorry\u2014I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d\n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts\u2014I did\u2014still do, \u2019smatter of fact.\u201d\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\n\n\u201cYer ticket fer Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst o\u2019 September\u2014King\u2019s Cross\u2014it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll know where to find me\u2026 See yeh soon, Harry.\u201d\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him\u2014in fact, they didn\u2019t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Uncle Vernon?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to\u2014to go to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n\u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u201d\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\n\u201cFunny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cWhere is this school, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\n\u201cI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\u2019clock,\u201d he read.\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\n\u201cPlatform what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on my ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201chowling mad, the lot of them. You\u2019ll see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take you to King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\n\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle Vernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\u201d\n\nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes\u2014he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine\u2014platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do they?\u201d\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\n\n\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2014packed with Muggles, of course\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\u2019s in front of him\u2014and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s the platform number?\u201d said the boys\u2019 mother.\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters!\u201d piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, \u201cMom, can\u2019t I go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\u201d\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it\u2014but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n\u201cFred, you next,\u201d the plump woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u201d said the boy. \u201cHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m George?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, George, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, I am Fred,\u201d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone\u2014but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there\u2014and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\u2019t anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s new, too.\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe thing is\u2014the thing is, I don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to get onto the platform?\u201d she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr\u2014okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\u2019d be in trouble\u2014leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run\u2014the barrier was coming nearer and nearer\u2014he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop\u2014the cart was out of control\u2014he was a foot away\u2014he closed his eyes ready for the crash\u2014\n\nIt didn\u2019t come\u2026 he kept on running\u2026 he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o\u2019clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-quarters on it. He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying, \u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Neville,\u201d he heard the old woman sigh.\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\n\u201cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\u201d\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\n\u201cWant a hand?\u201d It was one of the red haired twins he\u2019d followed through the barrier.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry panted.\n\n\u201cOy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u201d\n\nWith the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\u2019s lightning scar.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said the first twin. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he added to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d chorused the twins.\n\n\u201cOh, him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, yes, I am.\u201d\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\u2019s open door.\n\n\u201cFred? George? Are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing, Mom.\u201d\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n\u201cRon, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u201d\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n\u201cMom\u2014geroff\u2014\u201d He wriggled free.\n\n\u201cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Percy?\u201d said their mother.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\u201d said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \u201cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cOnce\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr twice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA minute\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll summer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Percy the Prefect.\n\n\u201cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u201d said one of the twins.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a prefect,\u201d said their mother fondly. \u201cAll right, dear, well, have a good term\u2014send me an owl when you get there.\u201d\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n\n\u201cNow, you two\u2014this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve blown up a toilet or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. And look after Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n\n\u201cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\u201d\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him looking.\n\n\u201cYou know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the little girl\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\u2019t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\u2019s really there\u2014like lightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor dear\u2014no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\u201d\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n\u201cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, keep your hair on.\u201d\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, Mom.\u201d\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\n\n\u201cAnyone sitting there?\u201d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \u201cEverywhere else is full.\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\n\n\u201cHey, Ron.\u201d\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re going down the middle of the train\u2014Lee Jordan\u2019s got a giant tarantula down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d mumbled Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said the other twin, \u201cdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\n\n\u201cAre you really Harry Potter?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\u2019s jokes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd have you really got\u2014you know\u2026\u201d\n\nHe pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where You-Know-Who\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\n\u201cAre all your family wizards?\u201d asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014Yes, I think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think Mom\u2019s got a second cousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you must know loads of magic already.\u201d\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\n\u201cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat are they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible\u2014well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\u2019d had three wizard brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \u201cI\u2019m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\u2019ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left\u2014Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\u2019re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand, and Percy\u2019s old rat.\u201d\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Scabbers and he\u2019s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\u2019t aff\u2014I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\u2019s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\n\u201c\u2026and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\u2014\u201d\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou said You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u201d said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you, of all people\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI just never knew you shouldn\u2019t. See what I mean? I\u2019ve got loads to learn\u2026 I bet,\u201d he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \u201cI bet I\u2019m the worst in the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be. There\u2019s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\u201d\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \u201cAnything off the cart, dears?\u201d\n\nHarry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\u2019s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\u2019d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry\u2014but the woman didn\u2019t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\n\n\u201cHungry, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStarving,\u201d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \u201cShe always forgets I don\u2019t like corned beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwap you for one of these,\u201d said Harry, holding up a pasty. \u201cGo on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, it\u2019s all dry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t got much time,\u201d he added quickly, \u201cyou know, with five of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, have a pasty,\u201d said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\u2019s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \u201cThey\u2019re not really frogs, are they?\u201d He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut see what the card is. I\u2019m missing Agrippa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course, you wouldn\u2019t know\u2014Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect\u2014famous witches and wizards. I\u2019ve got about five hundred, but I haven\u2019t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\u201d\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\u2019s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSo this is Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d never heard of Dumbledore!\u201d said Ron. \u201cCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa\u2014thanks\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\n\n\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\u2019s face had disappeared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again and I\u2019ve got about six of her\u2026 do you want it? You can start collecting.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u201d Ron sounded amazed. \u201cWeird!\u201d\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\u201cYou want to be careful with those,\u201d Ron warned Harry. \u201cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor\u2014you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\u201d\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n\n\u201cBleaaargh\u2014see? Sprouts.\u201d\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you seen a toad at all?\u201d\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \u201cI\u2019ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll turn up,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy miserably. \u201cWell, if you see him\u2026\u201d\n\nHe left.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf I\u2019d brought a toad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cHe might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference,\u201d said Ron in disgust. \u201cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, look\u2026\u201d\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n\n\u201cUnicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway\u2014\u201d\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\u2019s lost one,\u201d she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already told him we haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Ron, but the girl wasn\u2019t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\n\u201cOh, are you doing magic? Let\u2019s see it, then.\u201d\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014all right.\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\u2019s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\u2019s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\u2019ve heard\u2014I\u2019ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough\u2014I\u2019m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\u201d\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\u2019t learned all the course books by heart either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ron Weasley,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAre you really?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI know all about you, of course\u2014I got a few extra books for background reading, and you\u2019re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n\u201cGoodness, didn\u2019t you know, I\u2019d have found out everything I could if it was me,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDo either of you know what house you\u2019ll be in? I\u2019ve been asking around, and I hope I\u2019m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\u2019t be too bad\u2026 Anyway, we\u2019d better go and look for Neville\u2019s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n\u201cWhatever house I\u2019m in, I hope she\u2019s not in it,\u201d said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \u201cStupid spell\u2014George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat house are your brothers in?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cGryffindor,\u201d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \u201cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll say if I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the house Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\u2019 whiskers are a bit lighter,\u201d said Harry, trying to take Ron\u2019s mind off houses. \u201cSo what do your oldest brothers do now that they\u2019ve left, anyway?\u201d\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\u2019d finished school.\n\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\u2019s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDid you hear about Gringotts? It\u2019s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\u2019t suppose you get that with the Muggles\u2014someone tried to rob a high security vault.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cReally? What happened to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such big news. They haven\u2019t been caught. My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\u2019t think they took anything, that\u2019s what\u2019s odd. \u2019Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u201d\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \u201cVoldemort\u201d without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite Quidditch team?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014I don\u2019t know any,\u201d Harry confessed.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Ron looked dumbfounded. \u201cOh, you wait, it\u2019s the best game in the world\u2014\u201d And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\u2019d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\u2019d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\u2019t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\u2019d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\u2019s in this compartment. So it\u2019s you, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\n\n\u201cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u201d said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \u201cAnd my name\u2019s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n\n\u201cThink my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\u201d\n\nHe turned back to Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry didn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\u201d he said coolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn\u2019t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\u2019t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\u2019ll rub off on you.\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to fight us, are you?\u201d Malfoy sneered.\n\n\u201cUnless you get out now,\u201d said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\u2019ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\u201d\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron\u2014Ron leapt forward, but before he\u2019d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\u2019s knuckle\u2014Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\u2019d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n\n\u201cWhat has been going on?\u201d she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u201d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t believe it\u2014he\u2019s gone back to sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met Malfoy before?\u201d\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of his family,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\u2019d been bewitched. My dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He says Malfoy\u2019s father didn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\u201d He turned to Hermione. \u201cCan we help you with something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\u2019re nearly there. You haven\u2019t been fighting, have you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we even get there!\u201d\n\n\u201cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\u201d said Ron, scowling at her. \u201cWould you mind leaving while we change?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\u201d said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\u201d\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: \u201cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \u201cFirs\u2019 years! Firs\u2019 years over here! All right there, Harry?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, follow me\u2014any more firs\u2019 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\u2019 years follow me!\u201d\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019 all get yer firs\u2019 sight o\u2019 Hogwarts in a sec,\u201d Hagrid called over his shoulder, \u201cjus\u2019 round this bend here.\u201d\n\nThere was a loud \u201cOooooh!\u201d\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n\u201cNo more\u2019n four to a boat!\u201d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.\n\n\u201cEveryone in?\u201d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \u201cRight then\u2014FORWARD!\u201d\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n\u201cHeads down!\u201d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n\n\u201cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\u201d said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\n\n\u201cTrevor!\u201d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.\n\n\u201cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\u201d\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. THE SORTING HAT\n\n\n\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\u2019s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\n\n\u201cThe firs\u2019 years, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\u2019 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here\u2014but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Hogwarts,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThe start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n\n\u201cThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\n\u201cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\u201d\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\u2019s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\u2019s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n\n\u201cI shall return when we are ready for you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cPlease wait quietly.\u201d\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\u201cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\u201d he asked Ron.\n\n\u201cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet\u2014what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\u2019t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\u2019d learned and wondering which one she\u2019d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\u2019d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his teacher\u2019s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air\u2014several people behind him screamed.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\u2019s not really even a ghost\u2014I say, what are you all doing here?\u201d\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\u201cNew students!\u201d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \u201cAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?\u201d\n\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\n\u201cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\u201d said the Friar. \u201cMy old house, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove along now,\u201d said a sharp voice. \u201cThe Sorting Ceremony\u2019s about to start.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \u201cand follow me.\u201d\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the heavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in the house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing\u2014noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth\u2014and the hat began to sing:\n\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty,\n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see,\n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\n\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\n\nSet Gryffindors apart;\n\n\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\n\nAnd unafraid of toil;\n\n\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nIf you\u2019ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\n\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYou\u2019ll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\n\n\nSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid!\n\nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap!\n\nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u201d Ron whispered to Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott, Hannah!\u201d\n\nA pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause\u2014\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat.\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\n\n\u201cBones, Susan!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n\n\u201cBoot, Terry!\u201d\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n\n\u201cBrocklehurst, Mandy\u201d went to Ravenclaw too, but \u201cBrown, Lavender\u201d became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\u2019s twin brothers catcalling.\n\n\u201cBulstrode, Millicent\u201d then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\u2019s imagination, after all he\u2019d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n\n\u201cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \u201cFinnigan, Seamus,\u201d the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cGranger, Hermione!\u201d\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n\n\u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\u2019re very nervous. What if he wasn\u2019t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\u2019d better get back on the train?\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR,\u201d Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \u201cMacDougal, Morag.\u201d\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many people left now. \u201cMoon\u201d\u2026, \u201cNott\u201d\u2026, \u201cParkinson\u201d\u2026, then a pair of twin girls, \u201cPatil\u201d and \u201cPatil\u201d\u2026, then \u201cPerks, Sally Anne\u201d\u2026, and then, at last\u2014\n\n\u201cPotter, Harry!\u201d\n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n\n\u201cPotter, did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said a small voice in his ear. \u201cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\u2019s talent, ah my goodness, yes\u2014and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s interesting\u2026 So where shall I put you?\u201d\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n\n\u201cNot Slytherin, eh?\u201d said the small voice. \u201cAre you sure? You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that\u2014no? Well, if you\u2019re sure\u2014better be GRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \u201cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\u201d Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water.\n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ron, excellent,\u201d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \u201cZabini, Blaise,\u201d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not.\n\n\u201cIs he\u2014a bit mad?\u201d he asked Percy uncertainly.\n\n\u201cMad?\u201d said Percy airily. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n\n\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, \u201cCan\u2019t you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who you are!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cMy brothers told me about you\u2014you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy\u2014\u201d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\n\n\u201cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u201d\n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t going at all the way he wanted.\n\n\u201cLike this,\u201d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \u201cSo\u2014new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s becoming almost unbearable\u2014he\u2019s the Slytherin ghost.\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cHow did he get covered in blood?\u201d asked Seamus with great interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding\u2014\u201d\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m half-and-half,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cMe dad\u2019s a Muggle. Mom didn\u2019t tell him she was a witch \u2019til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\u201d\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Neville?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u201d said Neville, \u201cbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me\u2014he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned\u2014but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced\u2014all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here\u2014they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\u201d\n\nOn Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\u201cI do hope they start right away, there\u2019s so much to learn, I\u2019m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\u2019s supposed to be very difficult\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing\u2014\u201d).\n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s eyes\u2014and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Percy.\n\n\u201cN-nothing.\u201d\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\u2019s look\u2014a feeling that he didn\u2019t like Harry at all.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u201d he asked Percy.\n\n\u201cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\u2019s looking so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\u2019t want to\u2014everyone knows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\u201d\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\u2019t look at him again.\n\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\n\u201cAhem\u2014just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notices to give you.\n\n\u201cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\n\u201cI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\n\u201cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\u201d\n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not serious?\u201d he muttered to Percy.\n\n\u201cMust be,\u201d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re not allowed to go somewhere\u2014the forest\u2019s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\u201d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\u2019 smiles had become rather fixed.\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\n\u201cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand off we go!\u201d\n\nAnd the school bellowed:\n\nHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\n\nTeach us something please,\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees,\n\n\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff,\n\nFor now they\u2019re bare and full of air,\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\n\n\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\n\nBring back what we\u2019ve forgot,\n\nJust do your best, we\u2019ll do the rest,\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\n\u201cAh, music,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\u2019s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d Percy whispered to the first years. \u201cA poltergeist.\u201d He raised his voice, \u201cPeeves\u2014show yourself!\u201d\n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\u201d\n\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n\n\u201cOooooooh!\u201d he said, with an evil cackle. \u201cIckle Firsties! What fun!\u201d\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\n\u201cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I mean it!\u201d barked Percy.\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\n\u201cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\u201d said Percy, as they set off again. \u201cThe Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one who can control him, he won\u2019t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\u201d\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCaput Draconis,\u201d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it\u2014Neville needed a leg up\u2014and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase\u2014they were obviously in one of the towers\u2014they found their beds at last: five four posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\n\u201cGreat food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \u201cGet off, Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my sheets.\u201d\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\u2019s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully\u2014and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it\u2014then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold\u2014there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. THE POTIONS MASTER\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere, look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWearing the glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his scar?\u201d\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\n\nThere were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u2019t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\n\nThe ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \u201cGOT YOUR CONK!\u201d\n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\u2019s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u2019d whisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u2019s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\u201cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\u2019t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\u2019t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u2019t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have much of a head start.\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got today?\u201d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\n\n\u201cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape\u2019s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them\u2014we\u2019ll be able to see if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish McGonagall favored us,\u201d said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\u2019t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\n\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. Snape didn\u2019t dislike Harry\u2014he hated him.\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAh, Yes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new\u2014celebrity.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had none of Hagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\u2014like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little foolish wand waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\u2026 I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death\u2014if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d\n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\u2019t a dunderhead.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot into the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSnape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\u201cTut, tut\u2014fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\nHe ignored Hermione\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201d\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\u201d Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\u201d\n\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione does, though, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d\n\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \u201cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \u201cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\u201d\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\n\n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014Potter\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\u201d\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u2019d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week\u2014why did Snape hate him so much?\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Ron, \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\u201d\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u2019s voice rang out, saying, \u201cBack, Fang\u2014back.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d he said. \u201cBack, Fang.\u201d\n\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\n\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\n\u201cMake yerselves at home,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\n\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s freckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\u201d\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u2019s knee and drooled all over his robes.\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \u201cthat old git.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get rid of her\u2014Fitch puts her up to it.\u201d\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\n\u201cBut he seemed to really hate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhy should he?\u201d\n\nYet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u201d Hagrid asked Ron. \u201cI liked him a lot\u2014great with animals.\u201d\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\n\n\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t mentioned the date.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Gringotts break in happened on my birthday! It might\u2019ve been happening while we were there!\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t meet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u2019d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u2019t want to tell Harry?\n\n\n\n\n\n9. THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\n\n\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u2019t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday\u2014and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\u201d\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cAnyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u2019s all talk.\u201d\n\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of a book\u2014not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\u2019s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Remembrall!\u201d he explained. \u201cGran knows I forget things\u2014this tells you if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red\u2014oh\u2026\u201d His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u201c\u2026you\u2019ve forgotten something\u2026\u201d\n\nNeville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got my Remembrall, Professor.\u201d\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\n\u201cJust looking,\u201d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\n\nAt three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked. \u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\n\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom,\u201d called Madam Hooch at the front, \u201cand say \u2018Up!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUP!\u201d everyone shouted.\n\nHarry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u2019d been doing it wrong for years.\n\n\u201cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle\u2014three\u2014two\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\u2019s lips.\n\n\u201cCome back, boy!\u201d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle\u2014twelve feet\u2014twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and\u2014\n\nWHAM\u2014a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n\n\u201cBroken wrist,\u201d Harry heard her mutter. \u201cCome on, boy\u2014it\u2019s all right, up you get.\u201d\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\n\u201cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\u2019ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \u2018Quidditch.\u2019 Come on, dear.\u201d\n\nNeville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n\n\u201cDid you see his face, the great lump?\u201d\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d snapped Parvati Patil.\n\n\u201cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\u201d said Pansy Parkinson, a hard faced Slytherin girl. \u201cNever thought you\u2019d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid thing Longbottom\u2019s gran sent him.\u201d\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\n\u201cGive that here, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find\u2014how about\u2014up a tree?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it here!\u201d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\u2019t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \u201cCome and get it, Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Hermione Granger. \u201cMadam Hooch told us not to move\u2014you\u2019ll get us all into trouble.\u201d\n\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\u2019d found something he could do without being taught\u2014this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d Harry called, \u201cor I\u2019ll knock you off that broom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\n\u201cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\u201d Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\u201cCatch it if you can, then!\u201d he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\u2014next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\u2014wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching\u2014he stretched out his hand\u2014a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\n\u201cHARRY POTTER!\u201d\n\nHis heart sank faster than he\u2019d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\n\u201cNever\u2014in all my time at Hogwarts\u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \u201c\u2014how dare you\u2014might have broken your neck\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault, Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Miss Patil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Malfoy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\u201d\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u2019s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\u2019s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted two weeks. He\u2019d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\u201d\n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth year boy who came out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking confused.\n\n\u201cFollow me, you two,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n\n\u201cIn here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n\n\u201cOut, Peeves!\u201d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n\n\u201cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood\u2014I\u2019ve found you a Seeker.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n\n\u201cAre you serious, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cThe boy\u2019s a natural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\n\n\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive,\u201d Professor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n\n\u201cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\u201d he asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cWood\u2019s captain of the Gryffindor team,\u201d Professor McGonagall explained.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the build for a Seeker, too,\u201d said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \u201cLight\u2014speedy\u2014we\u2019ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor\u2014a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u2019t bend the first year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks\u2026\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n\n\u201cI want to hear you\u2019re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\u201d\n\nThen she suddenly smiled.\n\n\u201cYour father would have been proud,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all about it.\n\n\u201cSeeker?\u201d he said. \u201cBut first years never\u2014you must be the youngest house player in about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014a century,\u201d said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \u201cWood told me.\u201d\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n\n\u201cI start training next week,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnly don\u2019t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said George in a low voice. \u201cWood told us. We\u2019re on the team too\u2014Beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, we\u2019re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won since Charlie left, but this year\u2019s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u2019s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet it\u2019s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\u201d\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot braver now that you\u2019re back on the ground and you\u2019ve got your little friends with you,\u201d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take you on anytime on my own,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cTonight, if you want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only\u2014no contact. What\u2019s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Ron, wheeling around. \u201cI\u2019m his second, who\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n\n\u201cCrabbe,\u201d he said. \u201cMidnight all right? We\u2019ll meet you in the trophy room; that\u2019s always unlocked.\u201d\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \u201cWhat is a wizard\u2019s duel?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd what do you mean, you\u2019re my second?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u201d said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u2019s face, he added quickly, \u201cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\u201d Ron suggested.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t a person eat in peace in this place?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you could,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201c\u2014and you mustn\u2019t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if you\u2019re caught, and you\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very selfish of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Ron.\n\nAll the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u2019t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \u201cIf he tries to curse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t remember how to block them.\u201d There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness\u2014this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face to face. He couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\n\u201cHalf past eleven,\u201d Ron muttered at last, \u201cwe\u2019d better go.\u201d\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to do this, Harry.\u201d\n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cGo back to bed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost told your brother,\u201d Hermione snapped, \u201cPercy\u2014he\u2019s a prefect, he\u2019d put a stop to this.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n\nHermione wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\u2019t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\u2019ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\u2019re on the train home tomorrow, you\u2019re so\u2014\u201d\n\nBut what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\n\n\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d she asked shrilly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\nThey hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\u2019ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve\u2014\u201d said Ron loudly.\n\n\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cI heard something.\u201d\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n\n\u201cMrs. Norris?\u201d breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n\n\u201cThank goodness you found me! I\u2019ve been out here for hours, I couldn\u2019t remember the new password to get in to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\u2019s \u2018Pig snout\u2019 but it won\u2019t help you now, the Fat Lady\u2019s gone off somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Neville, showing them. \u201cMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u2014well, look, Neville, we\u2019ve got to be somewhere, we\u2019ll see you later\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u2019s been past twice already.\u201d\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\n\n\u201cIf either of you get us caught, I\u2019ll never rest until I\u2019ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\u201d\n\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn\u2019t Malfoy.\n\n\u201cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\u201d\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\u2019s voice. Neville\u2019s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in here somewhere,\u201d they heard him mutter, \u201cprobably hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following\u2014they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going\u2014they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n\n\u201cI\u2014told\u2014you,\u201d Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \u201cI\u2014told\u2014you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\u201d said Ron, \u201cquickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy tricked you,\u201d Hermione said to Harry. \u201cYou realize that, don\u2019t you? He was never going to meet you\u2014Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\u201d\n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. They hadn\u2019t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n\n\u201cShut up, Peeves\u2014please\u2014you\u2019ll get us thrown out.\u201d\n\nPeeves cackled.\n\n\u201cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\u2019ll get caughty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t give us away, Peeves, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould tell Filch, I should,\u201d said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\n\n\u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\u201d Peeves bellowed, \u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\u2014\u201d\n\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door\u2014and it was locked.\n\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \u201cWe\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u201d They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\u2019s shouts.\n\n\u201cOh, move over,\u201d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u2019s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \u201cAlohomora!\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open\u2014they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\n\u201cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\u201d Filch was saying. \u201cQuick, tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cShan\u2019t say nothing if you don\u2019t say please,\u201d said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing if you didn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u201d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\n\u201cHe thinks this door is locked,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay\u2014get off, Neville!\u201d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u2019s bathrobe for the last minute. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry turned around\u2014and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\u2019d walked into a nightmare\u2014this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\n\nThey weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob\u2014between Filch and death, he\u2019d take Filch.\n\nThey fell backward\u2014Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\u2019t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared\u2014all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\n\u201cWhere on earth have you all been?\u201d she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\n\u201cNever mind that\u2014pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\u2019d never speak again.\n\n\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\u201d\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \u201cYou don\u2019t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\u201d she snapped. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what it was standing on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe floor?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s obviously guarding something.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\u2014or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think we dragged her along, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something\u2026 What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide\u2014except perhaps Hogwarts.\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n\n\n\n\n\n10. HALLOWEEN\n\n\n\n\nMalfoy couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOr both,\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\u2019t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a broomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\u2019clock for your first training session.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\u201d Ron moaned enviously. \u201cI\u2019ve never even touched one.\u201d\n\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t resist it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry. \u201cComets look flashy, but they\u2019re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u2019t afford half the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back. \u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked.\n\n\u201cPotter\u2019s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said Malfoy quickly.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u201d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u201d he added.\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t stolen Neville\u2019s Remembrall I wouln\u2019t be on the team\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking rules?\u201d came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t stop now,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019s doing us so much good.\u201d\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\u2019s bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n\nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\u2019d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling\u2014he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\n\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what McGonagall meant\u2026 you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team practice three times a week.\u201d\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different sized balls.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo\u2014that\u2019s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called the Keeper. I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air\u2014it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \u201cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u2019s why you have two Beaters on each team\u2014the Weasley twins are ours\u2014it\u2019s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So\u2014think you\u2019ve got all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\u201d Harry reeled off.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood.\n\n\u201cEr\u2014have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u201d Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\n\n\u201cNever at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014unless they crack my head open.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers\u2014I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\u201d\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the most important ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch because it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\u2014I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it\u2014any questions?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t practice with the Snitch yet,\u201d said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \u201cit\u2019s too dark, we might lose it. Let\u2019s try you out with a few of these.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u2019t carry on.\n\n\u201cThat Quidditch cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u201d said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing dragons.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\u2019d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\u2019s broomstick had arrived.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve been practicing!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too\u2014never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f\u2019 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\u201d\n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it\u2014Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n\nRon, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more luck.\n\n\u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it wrong,\u201d Harry heard Hermione snap. \u201cIt\u2019s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \u2018gar\u2019 nice and long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u201d Ron snarled.\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\n\n\u201cOh, well done!\u201d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \u201cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u201d\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u201d he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \u201cshe\u2019s a nightmare, honestly.\u201d\n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face\u2014and was startled to see that she was in tears.\n\n\u201cI think she heard you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \u201cShe must\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u201d\n\nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u2019 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start of term banquet.\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u2019s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \u201cTroll\u2014in the dungeons\u2014thought you ought to know.\u201d\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence.\n\n\u201cPrefects,\u201d he rumbled, \u201clead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\u201d\n\nPercy was in his element.\n\n\u201cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could a troll get in?\u201d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\u201d\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought\u2014Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u201d\n\nRon bit his lip.\n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut Percy\u2019d better not see us.\u201d\n\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\u2019 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch me.\u201d\n\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\u2019s fading footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u201d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n\n\u201cCan you smell something?\u201d\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n\nAnd then they heard it\u2014a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed\u2014at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n\n\u201cThe keys in the lock,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could lock it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop\u2014a high, petrified scream\u2014and it was coming from the chamber they\u2019d just chained up.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d they said together.\n\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\n\n\u201cConfuse it!\u201d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n\n\u201cOy, pea brain!\u201d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u2019t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n\n\u201cCome on, run, run!\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\u2019s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his hand when he\u2019d jumped\u2014it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s nostrils.\n\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\u2014not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over\u2014and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\n\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\n\n\u201cIs it\u2014dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think it\u2019s just been knocked out.\u201d\n\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n\n\u201cUrgh\u2014troll boogers.\u201d\n\nHe wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers.\n\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\u2019t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u201d\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cPlease, Professor McGonagall\u2014they were looking for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n\n\u201cI went looking for the troll because I\u2014I thought I could deal with it on my own\u2014you know, because I\u2019ve read all about them.\u201d\n\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u2019t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u2019t new to them.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014in that case\u2026\u201d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \u201cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\u201d\n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in you. If you\u2019re not hurt at all, you\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\u201d\n\nHermione left.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\u201d\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\n\n\u201cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\u201d Ron grumbled.\n\n\u201cFive, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u201d Ron admitted. \u201cMind you, we did save her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t locked the thing in with her,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n\n\u201cPig snout,\u201d they said and entered.\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d and hurried off to get plates.\n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n11. QUIDDITCH\n\n\n\n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\u2019t know which was worse\u2014people telling him he\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\n\n\u201cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,\u201d said Snape. \u201cGive it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just made that rule up,\u201d Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \u201cWonder what\u2019s wrong with his leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u201d said Ron bitterly.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\u2019s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\u201cHow will you learn?\u201d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.\n\n\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside\u2014and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\n\n\u201cBlasted thing,\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but\u2014\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\n\n\u201cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGET OUT! OUT!\u201d\n\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\n\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Ron asked as Harry joined them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\u2019d seen.\n\n\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d he finished breathlessly. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was going when we saw him\u2014he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! And I\u2019d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were wide.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not very nice, but he wouldn\u2019t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cI\u2019m with Harry. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past Snape. But what\u2019s he after? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u201d\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He tried to empty his mind\u2014he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours\u2014but the expression on Snape\u2019s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\u2019t easy to forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat some breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a bit of toast,\u201d wheedled Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\u2019s time he\u2019d be walking onto the field.\n\n\u201cHarry, you need your strength,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan. \u201cSeekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Seamus,\u201d said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.\n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\u201cOkay, men,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d Wood agreed. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big one,\u201d said Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cThe one we\u2019ve all been waiting for,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWe know Oliver\u2019s speech by heart,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cwe were on the team last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you two,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis is the best team Gryffindor\u2019s had in years. We\u2019re going to win. I know it.\u201d\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \u201cOr else.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. It\u2019s time. Good luck, all of you.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\u2019t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\n\n\u201cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\u201d she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\n\n\u201cMount your brooms, please.\u201d\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\n\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\n\n\u201cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor\u2014what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Professor.\u201d\n\nThe Weasley twins\u2019 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\u2019s, last year only a reserve\u2014back to Johnson and\u2014no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes\u2014Flint flying like an eagle up there\u2014he\u2019s going to sc\u2014no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle\u2014that\u2019s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and\u2014OUCH\u2014that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger\u2014Quaffle taken by the Slytherins\u2014that\u2019s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\u2019s blocked by a second Bludger\u2014sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\u2019t tell which\u2014nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes\u2014she\u2019s really flying\u2014dodges a speeding Bludger\u2014the goal posts are ahead\u2014come on, now, Angelina\u2014Keeper Bletchley dives\u2014misses\u2014GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\n\n\u201cBudge up there, move along.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\n\n\u201cBin watchin\u2019 from me hut,\u201d said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the same as bein\u2019 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had much to do yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKept outta trouble, though, that\u2019s somethin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\n\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\u2019s game plan.\n\n\u201cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\u201d Wood had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you attacked before you have to be.\u201d\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\u2019 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession,\u201d Lee Jordan was saying, \u201cChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the\u2014wait a moment\u2014was that the Snitch?\u201d\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs\u2014he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead\u2014he put on an extra spurt of speed\u2014\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below\u2014Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\u2019s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \u201cSend him off, ref! Red card!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cRed card!\u201d said Dean furiously. \u201cIn soccer you get shown the red card and you\u2019re out of the game!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t soccer, Dean,\u201d Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\u201d\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan!\u201d growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cI mean, after that open and revolting foul\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJordan, I\u2019m warning you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u201d\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts\u2014he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out\u2014and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession\u2014Flint with the Quaffle\u2014passes Spinnet\u2014passes Bell\u2014hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\u2014only joking, Professor\u2014Slytherins score\u2014A no\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\u201cDunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \u201cIf I didn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d lost control of his broom\u2026 but he can\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\u2019s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\n\n\u201cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\u201d Seamus whispered.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have,\u201d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \u201cCan\u2019t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic\u2014no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\u201d\n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\u2019s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d moaned Ron, gray faced.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Hermione gasped, \u201cSnape\u2014look.\u201d\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing something\u2014jinxing the broom,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good\u2014every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately.\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\u2019s robes.\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row\u2014Snape would never know what had happened.\n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\n\n\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes.\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick\u2014he hit the field on all fours\u2014coughed\u2014and something gold fell into his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u201d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\u201d Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference\u2014Harry hadn\u2019t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results\u2014Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt was Snape,\u201d Ron was explaining, \u201cHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \u201cWhy would Snape do somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\n\n\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d he told Hagrid. \u201cHe tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\n\n\u201cHow do you know about Fluffy?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFluffy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014he\u2019s mine\u2014bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\u2019 year\u2014I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t ask me anymore,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cThat\u2019s top secret, that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Snape\u2019s trying to steal it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cSnape\u2019s a Hogwarts teacher, he\u2019d do nothin\u2019 of the sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why did he just try to kill Harry?\u201d cried Hermione.\n\nThe afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.\n\n\u201cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\u2019ve read all about them! You\u2019ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\u2019t blinking at all, I saw him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u201d said Hagrid hotly. \u201cI don\u2019 know why Harry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh\u2014yer meddlin\u2019 in things that don\u2019 concern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019 you forget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor Dumbledore an\u2019 Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. THE MIRROR OF ERISED\n\n\n\n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\n\n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted at home.\u201d\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\u2019d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s cold drawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose\u2014that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u201d\n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d\n\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\u201d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \u201cMalfoy was insultin\u2019 his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\u2019t more. Move along, all of you.\u201d\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s back, \u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll get him\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them both,\u201d said Harry, \u201cMalfoy and Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cTell yeh what, come with me an\u2019 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\u201d\n\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\n\n\u201cAh, Hagrid, the last tree\u2014put it in the far corner, would you?\u201d\n\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\n\n\u201cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\u201d Hagrid asked.\n\n\u201cJust one,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd that reminds me\u2014Harry, Ron, we\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\n\n\u201cThe library?\u201d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \u201cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re not working,\u201d Harry told him brightly. \u201cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been trying to find out who he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Hagrid looked shocked. \u201cListen here\u2014I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that dog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u201d Harry added. \u201cWe must\u2019ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\u2019t find him anywhere\u2014just give us a hint\u2014I know I\u2019ve read his name somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid flatly.\n\n\u201cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\u201d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on\u2014out!\u201d\n\nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\n\n\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork\u2014bread, English muffins, marshmallows\u2014and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family\u2014in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \u201cDon\u2019t send me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWill you look at this? I\u2019ve got some presents!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect, turnips?\u201d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s.\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it\u2014it sounded a bit like an owl.\n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.\n\n\n\nTaped to the note was a fifty pence piece.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s friendly,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n\n\u201cWeird!\u201d he said, \u201cWhat a shape! This is money?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \u201cHagrid and my aunt and uncle\u2014so who sent these?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u201d said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \u201cMy mom. I told her you didn\u2019t expect any presents and\u2014oh, no,\u201d he groaned, \u201cshe\u2019s made you a Weasley sweater.\u201d\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n\n\u201cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\u201d said Ron, unwrapping his own, \u201cand mine\u2019s always maroon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of her,\u201d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.\n\nHis next present also contained candy\u2014a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\n\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those,\u201d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\u2019d gotten from Hermione. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is\u2014they\u2019re really rare, and really valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is\u2014try it on.\u201d\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n\n\u201cIt is! Look down!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a note!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cA note fell out of it!\u201d\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n\nYour father left this in my possession before he died.\n\nIt is time it was returned to you.\n\nUse it well.\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\n\n\n\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give anything for one of these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, look\u2014Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred, holding up Harry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re not family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George demanded. \u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u201d George observed. \u201cI suppose she thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid\u2014we know we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise.\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n\n\u201cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t\u2014want,\u201d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\u201d said George. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d\n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce\u2014and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\u2019s Christmas dinner.\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much.\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge.\n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.\n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n\nHis father\u2019s\u2026 this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\n\nUse it well.\n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.\n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\u2014his father\u2019s cloak\u2014he felt that this time\u2014the first time\u2014he wanted to use it alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.\n\nThe library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence\u2014the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside\u2014stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\u2019t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\n\n\u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library Restricted Section.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \u201cThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him\u2014the cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid.\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket\u2014but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed\u2014for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder\u2014but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\u2019s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air\u2014she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes\u2014her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green\u2014exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\u2019s did.\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees\u2014Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face, whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried from the room.\n\n\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly.\n\n\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\u2019t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou look odd.\u201d\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m freezing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s forget it and go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Harry hissed. I know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here\u2014just here\u2014yes!\u201d\n\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\n\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! Look at them all\u2026 there are loads of them\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u201d\n\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\u2019t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\n\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCan you see all your family standing around you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m alone\u2014but I\u2019m different\u2014I look older\u2014and I\u2019m head boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am\u2014I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to\u2014and I\u2019m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup\u2014I\u2019m Quidditch captain, too.\u201d\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can it? All my family are dead\u2014let me have another look\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\u2019s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me\u2014\u201d\n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\u2019t realized how loudly they had been talking.\n\n\u201cQuick!\u201d\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing\u2014did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe\u2014she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\u201d\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\n\nThe snow still hadn\u2019t melted the next morning.\n\n\u201cWant to play chess, Harry?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go down and visit Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 you go\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\u2019t go back tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it\u2014and anyway, you\u2019ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\u2019t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Harry, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\u2019t going to stop him.\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\u2019t meet anyone.\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\n\nExcept\u2014\n\n\u201cSo\u2014back again, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him.\n\n\u201c\u2014I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \u201cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I expect you\u2019ve realized by now what it does?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2014well\u2014it shows me my family\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\u201d\n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \u201cIt shows us what we want\u2026 whatever we want\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\n\n\u201cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\u201d\n\nHarry stood up.\n\n\u201cSir\u2014Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u201d Dumbledore smiled. \u201cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cOne can never have enough socks,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnother Christmas has come and gone and I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\u201d\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\n\n\n\n\n\n13. NICOLAS FLAMEL\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\u2019d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\u201d said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\u201cIf Filch had caught you!\u201d), and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\u2019d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\n\n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an excuse to pick on us.\u201d\n\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\u2026\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me for a moment,\u201d said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \u201cI need to concen\u2014\u201d He caught sight of Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You look terrible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\u2019s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play,\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re ill,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cPretend to break your leg,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cReally break your leg,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u2019s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\u2019s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d said Neville shakily. \u201cI met him outside the library. He said he\u2019d been looking for someone to practice that on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Professor McGonagall!\u201d Hermione urged Neville. \u201cReport him!\u201d\n\nNeville shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want more trouble,\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s used to walking all over people, but that\u2019s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to tell me I\u2019m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s already done that,\u201d Neville choked out.\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worth twelve of Malfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\u2019t it? And where\u2019s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n\n\u201cThanks, Harry\u2026 I think I\u2019ll go to bed\u2026 D\u2019you want the card, you collect them, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n\n\u201cDumbledore again,\u201d he said, \u201cHe was the first one I ever\u2014\u201d\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found him!\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve found Flamel! I told you I\u2019d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here\u2014listen to this: \u2018Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u2019!\u201d\n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u2019t looked so excited since they\u2019d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n\n\u201cStay there!\u201d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\u2019 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\n\u201cI never thought to look in here!\u201d she whispered excitedly. \u201cI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cLight?\u201d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\u2019d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we allowed to speak yet?\u201d said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cNicolas Flamel,\u201d she whispered dramatically, \u201cis the only known maker of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone!\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t have quite the effect she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, honestly, don\u2019t you two read? Look\u2014read that, there.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\n\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).\n\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \u201cThe dog must be guarding Flamel\u2019s Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\u2019re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\u2019s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\u201cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo wonder Snape\u2019s after it! Anyone would want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no wonder we couldn\u2019t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly recent if he\u2019s six hundred and sixty five, is he?\u201d\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\u2019d do with a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone if they had one. It wasn\u2019t until Ron said he\u2019d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, all the Slytherins will think I\u2019m just too scared to face Snape. I\u2019ll show them\u2026 it\u2019ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as long as we\u2019re not wiping you off the field,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\u2019t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\u2019d found out about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone? Harry didn\u2019t see how he could\u2014yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\n\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\u2019d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker Curse. They\u2019d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s Locomotor Mortis,\u201d Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ron snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t nag.\u201d\n\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\u2019s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s out there!\u201d said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \u201cEven\u2014blimey\u2014Dumbledore\u2019s come to watch!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart did a somersault.\n\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief\u2014He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Snape look so mean,\u201d he told Hermione. \u201cLook they\u2019re off\u2014Ouch!\u201d\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cWonder how long Potter\u2019s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\n\u201cYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\u201d said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \u201cIt\u2019s people they feel sorry for. See, there\u2019s Potter, who\u2019s got no parents, then there\u2019s the Weasleys, who\u2019ve got no money\u2014you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\u2019ve got no brains.\u201d\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\u201d he stammered.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \u201cYou tell him, Neville.\u201d\n\n\u201cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\u2019d be poorer than Weasley, and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Malfoy\u2014one more word\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione suddenly, \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u2019s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\u201d said Malfoy.\n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape\u2014she didn\u2019t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches\u2014the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\n\u201cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\u2019s over! Harry\u2019s won! We\u2019ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\u201d shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d done it\u2014the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped\u2014then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\u2019s smiling face.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \u201cNice to see you haven\u2019t been brooding about that mirror\u2026 been keeping busy\u2026 excellent\u2026\u201d\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\u2019t ever remember feeling happier. He\u2019d really done something to be proud of now\u2014no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d shown Snape\u2026\n\nAnd speaking of Snape\u2026\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\u2019s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\u2019s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\u2014what was going on?\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\u2019t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\n\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\u2019t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u2019t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\n\n\u201c\u2026d-don\u2019t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I thought we\u2019d keep this private,\u201d said Snape, his voice icy. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, after all.\u201d\n\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\u2019s yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cB-b-but Severus, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\u201d said Snape, taking a step toward him.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\u201d\n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \u201c\u2014your little bit of hocus pocus. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cB-but I d-d-don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Snape cut in. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another little chat soon, when you\u2019ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry, where have you been?\u201d Hermione squeaked.\n\n\u201cWe won! You won! We won!\u201d shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \u201cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He\u2019s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he\u2019ll be all right\u2014talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\u2019s waiting for you in the common room, we\u2019re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that now,\u201d said Harry breathlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s find an empty room, you wait \u2019til you hear this\u2026\u201d\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\u2019t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\u2019d seen and heard.\n\n\u201cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, and Snape\u2019s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy\u2014and he said something about Quirrell\u2019s \u2018hocus pocus\u2019\u2014I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you mean the Stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\u201d said Hermione in alarm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\n\n\n14. NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\n\n\n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\u2019d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter.\n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\u2019t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\n\n\u201cHermione, the exams are ages away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen weeks,\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s not ages, that\u2019s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not six hundred years old,\u201d Ron reminded her. \u201cAnyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\u2019s an A.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\u2019re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me\u2026\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\u2019t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never remember this,\u201d Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\u2019d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget me not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\n\nHarry, who was looking up \u201cDittany\u201d in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\u2019t look up until he heard Ron say, \u201cHagrid! What are you doing in the library?\u201d\n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 lookin\u2019,\u201d he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \u201cAn\u2019 what\u2019re you lot up ter?\u201d He looked suddenly suspicious. \u201cYer not still lookin\u2019 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\u201d said Ron impressively. \u201cAnd we know what that dog\u2019s guarding, it\u2019s a Sorcerer\u2019s St\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \u201cDon\u2019 go shoutin\u2019 about it, what\u2019s the matter with yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\u201d said Harry, \u201cabout what\u2019s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHHHH!\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cListen\u2014come an\u2019 see me later, I\u2019m not promisin\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh anythin\u2019, mind, but don\u2019 go rabbitin\u2019 about it in here, students aren\u2019 s\u2019pposed ter know. They\u2019ll think I\u2019ve told yeh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you later, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid shuffled off.\n\n\u201cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see what section he was in,\u201d said Ron, who\u2019d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.\n\n\u201cDragons!\u201d he whispered. \u201cHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\u2019s Guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s against our laws,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\u2019 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\u2019s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\u2019re keeping dragons in the back garden\u2014anyway, you can\u2019t tame dragons, it\u2019s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\u2019s got off wild ones in Romania.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t wild dragons in Britain?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOf course there are,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\u2019ve spotted them, to make them forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what on earths Hagrid up to?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\u2019s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \u201cWho is it?\u201d before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\u201cSo\u2014yeh wanted to ask me somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \u201cWe were wondering if you could tell us what\u2019s guarding the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone apart from Fluffy.\u201d\n\nHagrid frowned at him.\n\n\u201cO\u2019 course I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019 know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\u2019 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\u2019s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts\u2014I s\u2019ppose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\u201d said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\u2019s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \u201cWe only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 s\u2019pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 he borrowed Fluffy from me\u2026 then some o\u2019 the teachers did enchantments\u2026 Professor Sprout\u2014Professor Flitwick\u2014Professor McGonagall\u2014\u201d he ticked them off on his fingers, \u201cProfessor Quirrell\u2014an\u2019 Dumbledore himself did somethin\u2019, o\u2019 course. Hang on, I\u2019ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014yer not still on abou\u2019 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\u2019s not about ter steal it.\u201d\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything\u2014except, it seemed, Quirrell\u2019s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren\u2019t you, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry anxiously. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a soul knows except me an\u2019 Dumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid proudly.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d Harry muttered to the others. \u201cHagrid, can we have a window open? I\u2019m boiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \u201cThat\u2019s er\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \u201cIt must\u2019ve cost you a fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLas\u2019 night. I was down in the village havin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you going to do with it when it\u2019s hatched?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bin doin\u2019 some readin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \u201cGot this outta the library\u2014Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit\u2014it\u2019s a bit outta date, o\u2019 course, but it\u2019s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019 see here\u2014how ter recognize diff\u2019rent eggs\u2014what I got there\u2019s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\u2019re rare, them.\u201d\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n\n\u201cWonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u201d Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\u2019s hatching.\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lessons, we\u2019ll get into trouble, and that\u2019s nothing to what Hagrid\u2019s going to be in when someone finds out what he\u2019s doing\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Harry whispered.\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\u2019t like the look on Malfoy\u2019s face at all.\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\u2019s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly out.\u201d He ushered them inside.\n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\u2019t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n\n\u201cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\u201d\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\u2014he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains\u2014it\u2019s a kid\u2014he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u201d\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\u2019s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\n\u201cJust let him go,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cSet him free.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHe\u2019s too little. He\u2019d die.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u201d said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \u201cHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry loudly, \u201cgive it two weeks and Norbert\u2019s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\u201d\n\nHagrid bit his lip.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I know I can\u2019t keep him forever, but I can\u2019t jus\u2019 dump him, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \u201cCharlie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m Ron, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014Charlie\u2014your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow about it, Hagrid?\u201d\n\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.\n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\n\n\u201cIt bit me!\u201d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\u201d\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hedwig!\u201d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \u201cShe\u2019ll have Charlie\u2019s answer!\u201d\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter\u2014I\u2019d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\u2019t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\u2019t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\u2019s still dark.\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\n\nLove,\n\nCharlie\n\n\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too difficult\u2014I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert\u2014and Malfoy.\n\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey\u2014would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were poisonous.\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just my hand,\u201d he whispered, \u201calthough that feels like it\u2019s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me\u2014I\u2019ve told her it was a dog, but I don\u2019t think she believes me. I shouldn\u2019t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\u201d said Hermione, but this didn\u2019t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\n\n\u201cMidnight on Saturday!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. \u201cOh no\u2014oh no\u2014I\u2019ve just remembered\u2014Charlie\u2019s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\u2019s going to know we\u2019re getting rid of Norbert.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione didn\u2019t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change the plan now,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\u2019ll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you in,\u201d he puffed. \u201cNorbert\u2019s at a tricky stage\u2014nothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n\nWhen they told him about Charlie\u2019s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\n\u201cAargh! It\u2019s all right, he only got my boot\u2014jus\u2019 playin\u2019\u2014he\u2019s only a baby, after all.\u201d\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\u2019t come quickly enough.\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn\u2019t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\u2019s hut because they\u2019d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\u2019d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got lots o\u2019 rats an\u2019 some brandy fer the journey,\u201d said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\u201d\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\n\u201cBye bye, Norbert!\u201d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \u201cMommy will never forget you!\u201d\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another\u2014even one of Harry\u2019s shortcuts didn\u2019t make the work much easier.\n\n\u201cNearly there!\u201d Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\n\u201cDetention!\u201d she shouted. \u201cAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\u2019s coming\u2014he\u2019s got a dragon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on\u2014I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\u201d\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\u2019d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got detention! I could sing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.\n\nCharlie\u2019s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\u2019d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going\u2026 going\u2026 gone.\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon\u2014Malfoy in detention\u2014what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. THE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n\n\n\n\nThings couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\u2019t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \u201cI was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag\u2014\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\n\n\u201cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\u2019s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\u201d\n\nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville\u2014Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFour students out of bed in one night! I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions\u2014yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\u2019s very dangerous\u2014and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty?\u201d Harry gasped\u2014they would lose the lead, the lead he\u2019d won in the last Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cFifty points each,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\n\n\u201cProfessor\u2014please\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\u201d\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\u2019d done?\n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \u201cThanks, Potter, we owe you one!\u201d\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\u2019ve been here, and people still like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\u201d said Harry miserably.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014no,\u201d Ron admitted.\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t his business from now on. He\u2019d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\n\n\u201cResign?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat good\u2019ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\u2019t win at Quidditch?\u201d\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \u201cthe Seeker.\u201d\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as well known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions\u2026\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014not again, please\u2014\u201d\n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014all right\u2014\u201d he heard Quirrell sob.\n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\u2019d promised himself about not meddling.\n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step\u2014Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s done it, then!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf Quirrell\u2019s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still Fluffy, though,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cMaybe Snape\u2019s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\u201d said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \u201cI bet there\u2019s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\u201d\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\n\n\u201cGo to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got no proof!\u201d said Harry. \u201cQuirrell\u2019s too scared to back us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he doesn\u2019t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor\u2014who do you think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\u2019ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life depended on it, he\u2019s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\u2019ll think. And don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u201d\n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf we just do a bit of poking around\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly, \u201cwe\u2019ve done enough poking around.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.\n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven o\u2019clock tonight.\n\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\n\n\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\u2019t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\u2019d got.\n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock that night, they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\u2014and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\n\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\u2019t you, eh?\u201d he said, leering at them. \u201cOh yes\u2026 hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me\u2026 It\u2019s just a pity they let the old punishments die out\u2026 hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\u2019ve got the chains still in my office, keep \u2019em well oiled in case they\u2019re ever needed\u2026 Right, off we go, and don\u2019t think of running off, now, it\u2019ll be worse for you if you do.\u201d\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding so delighted.\n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \u201cI suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy\u2014it\u2019s into the forest you\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one piece.\u201d\n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n\u201cThe forest?\u201d he repeated, and he didn\u2019t sound quite as cool as usual. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there at night\u2014there\u2019s all sorts of things in there\u2014werewolves, I heard.\u201d\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\u2019s robe and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \u201cShould\u2019ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cAbou\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI bin waitin\u2019 fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\u201d said Filch coldly, \u201cthey\u2019re here to be punished, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yer late, is it?\u201d said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \u201cBin lecturin\u2019 them, eh? \u2019Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\u2019ve done yer bit, I\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back at dawn,\u201d said Filch, \u201cfor what\u2019s left of them,\u201d he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in that forest,\u201d he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\n\n\u201cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\u201d said Hagrid fiercely. \u201cYeh\u2019ve done wrong an\u2019 now yeh\u2019ve got ter pay fer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is servant stuff, it\u2019s not for students to do. I thought we\u2019d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014tell yer that\u2019s how it is at Hogwarts,\u201d Hagrid growled. \u201cCopyin\u2019 lines! What good\u2019s that ter anyone? Yeh\u2019ll do summat useful or yeh\u2019ll get out. If yeh think yer father\u2019d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\u2019 pack. Go on.\u201d\n\nMalfoy didn\u2019t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cnow, listen carefully, \u2019cause it\u2019s dangerous what we\u2019re gonna do tonight, an\u2019 I don\u2019 want no one takin\u2019 risks. Follow me over here a moment.\u201d\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\n\n\u201cLook there,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201csee that stuff shinin\u2019 on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\u2019s unicorn blood. There\u2019s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\u201d said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 that lives in the forest that\u2019ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\u2019re gonna split inter two parties an\u2019 follow the trail in diff\u2019rent directions. There\u2019s blood all over the place, it must\u2019ve bin staggerin\u2019 around since last night at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want Fang,\u201d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\u2019s long teeth.\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\u2019s a coward,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cSo me, Harry, an\u2019 Hermione\u2019ll go one way an\u2019 Draco, Neville, an\u2019 Fang\u2019ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\u2019ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\u2019 practice now\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014an\u2019 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\u2019 we\u2019ll all come an\u2019 find yeh\u2014so, be careful\u2014let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves.\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n\n\u201cCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cNot fast enough,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\u201d\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Hermione?\u201d Hagrid whispered. \u201cDon\u2019 worry, it can\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt, an\u2019 then we\u2019ll be able ter\u2014GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s summat in here that shouldn\u2019 be.\u201d\n\n\u201cA werewolf?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019 no werewolf an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 no unicorn, neither,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cRight, follow me, but careful, now.\u201d\n\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Hagrid called. \u201cShow yerself\u2014I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nAnd into the clearing came\u2014was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\u2019s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\u2019s jaws dropped.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid in relief. \u201cHow are yeh?\u201d\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\u201d said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \u201cWere you going to shoot me?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \u201cThere\u2019s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\u2019 Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\u2019 this is Ronan, you two. He\u2019s a centaur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d noticed,\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d said Hermione timidly.\n\n\u201cA bit. Well, that\u2019s something.\u201d Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \u201cMars is bright tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \u201cListen, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \u2019cause there\u2019s a unicorn bin hurt\u2014you seen anythin\u2019?\u201d\n\nRonan didn\u2019t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\n\n\u201cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut have yeh seen anythin\u2019, Ronan? Anythin\u2019 unusual?\u201d\n\n\u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \u201cUnusually bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I was meanin\u2019 anythin\u2019 unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \u201cSo yeh haven\u2019t noticed anythin\u2019 strange?\u201d\n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \u201cThe forest hides many secrets.\u201d\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.\n\n\u201cHullo, Bane,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell enough. Look, I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin askin\u2019 Ronan, you seen anythin\u2019 odd in here lately? There\u2019s a unicorn bin injured\u2014would yeh know anythin\u2019 about it?\u201d\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Hagrid grumpily. \u201cWell, if either of you do see anythin\u2019, let me know, won\u2019t yeh? We\u2019ll be off, then.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Hagrid irritably, \u201ctry an\u2019 get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\u2019 closer\u2019n the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many of them in here?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, a fair few\u2026 Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\u2019re good enough about turnin\u2019 up if ever I want a word. They\u2019re deep mind, centaurs\u2026 they know things\u2026 jus\u2019 don\u2019 let on much.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\u2019s bin killin\u2019 the unicorns\u2014never heard anythin\u2019 like it before.\u201d\n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two wait here!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cStay on the path, I\u2019ll come back for yeh!\u201d\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\u2019t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been hurt, do you?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Malfoy has, but if something\u2019s got Neville\u2026 it\u2019s our fault he\u2019s here in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two were makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups\u2014Neville, you stay with me an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019ll have a harder time frightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n\n\u201cLook\u2014\u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves.\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered\u2026 Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\u2019s side, and began to drink its blood.\n\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted\u2014so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry\u2014unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry\u2014he couldn\u2019t move for fear.\n\nThen a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.\n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and a palomino body.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014thank you\u2014what was that?\u201d\n\nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time\u2014especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.\n\n\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\n\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you realize who this is?\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been telling him?\u201d growled Bane. \u201cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\u201d\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\u201d he said in his gloomy voice.\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\n\u201cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\u201d\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\n\u201cDo you not see that unicorn?\u201d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \u201cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u201d\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s Bane so angry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\u201d\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\u2019s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u201cWe\u2019ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed, \u201cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else\u2014something that will bring you back to full strength and power\u2014something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! Of course\u2014the Elixir of Life! But I don\u2019t understand who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u201d\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Harry croaked, \u201cthat was Vol\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\u201d\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \u201cThe unicorn\u2019s dead, Hagrid, it\u2019s in that clearing back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \u201cYou are safe now.\u201d\n\nHarry slid off his back.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry Potter,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\u201d\n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\n\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\n\u201cSnape wants the stone for Voldemort\u2026 and Voldemort\u2019s waiting in the forest\u2026 and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying the name!\u201d said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\u2019t have done so\u2026 Bane was furious\u2026 he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen\u2026 They must show that Voldemort\u2019s coming back\u2026 Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me\u2026 I suppose that\u2019s written in the stars as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you stop saying the name!\u201d Ron hissed.\n\n\u201cSo all I\u2019ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\u201d Harry went on feverishly, \u201cthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off\u2026 Well, I suppose Bane\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n\n\u201cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\u2019t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\u2019s a very imprecise branch of magic.\u201d\n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\u2019s surprises weren\u2019t over.\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\n\nJust in case.\n\n\n\n\n\n16. THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\n\n\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\u2014points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\n\nMaybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\u2019t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the rest.\n\n\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \u201cI needn\u2019t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u201d\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \u201cNo more studying,\u201d Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \u201cYou could look more cheerful, Harry, we\u2019ve got a week before we find out how badly we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\u201d\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew what this means!\u201d he burst out angrily. \u201cMy scar keeps hurting\u2014it\u2019s happened before, but never as often as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ill,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a warning\u2026 it means danger\u2019s coming\u2026\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t get worked up, it was too hot.\n\n\u201cHarry, relax, Hermione\u2019s right, the Stone\u2019s safe as long as Dumbledore\u2019s around. Anyway, we\u2019ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\u2019s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\u2019d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \u201cThat\u2019s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\u2019d done that one.\u201d\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\u2019t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy\u2026 never\u2026 but\u2026\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d said Ron sleepily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d said Harry. He had turned white. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \u201cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it before?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\u2019t answer.\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\u2019ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Hagrid casually, \u201che wouldn\u2019 take his cloak off.\u201d\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head\u2014that\u2019s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\u2019 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\u201d\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \u201cWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cMighta come up,\u201d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \u201cYeah\u2026 he asked what I did, an\u2019 I told him I was gamekeeper here\u2026 He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after\u2026 so I told him\u2026 an\u2019 I said what I\u2019d always really wanted was a dragon\u2026 an\u2019 then\u2026 I can\u2019 remember too well, \u2019cause he kept buyin\u2019 me drinks\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\u2019 we could play cards fer it if I wanted\u2026 but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home\u2026 So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did he\u2014did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u201d Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014yeah\u2014how many three headed dogs d\u2019yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a piece o\u2019 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\u2019 play him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll go straight off ter sleep\u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u201d he blurted out. \u201cForget I said it! Hey\u2014where\u2019re yeh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\u2019t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak\u2014it must\u2019ve been easy, once he\u2019d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\u2019t stop him. Where\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to\u2014\u201d Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you three doing inside?\u201d\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\n\u201cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\n\u201cSee Professor Dumbledore?\u201d Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed\u2014now what?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of secret,\u201d he said, but he wished at once he hadn\u2019t, because Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils flared.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \u201cProfessor\u2014it\u2019s about the Sorcerer\u2019s stone\u2014\u201d\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\u2019t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\u2019t pick them up. \u201cHow do you know ?\u201d she spluttered.\n\n\u201cProfessor, I think\u2014I know\u2014that Sn\u2014that someone\u2019s going to try and steal the Stone. I\u2019ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\u2019s too well protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \u201cI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \u201cSnape\u2019s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\u2019s found out everything he needs, and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what can we\u2014\u201d\n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n\nSnape was standing there.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said smoothly.\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this,\u201d he said, with an odd, twisted smile.\n\n\u201cWe were\u2014\u201d Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n\n\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHanging around like this, people will think you\u2019re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\u2019t afford to lose any more points, can it?\u201d\n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n\n\u201cBe warned, Potter\u2014any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\u201d\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n\n\u201cRight, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape\u2014wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\u201d He put on a high voice, \u201c\u2018Oh Professor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d better stay outside the third floor corridor,\u201d Harry told Ron. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nBut that part of the plan didn\u2019t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n\n\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\u201d she stormed. \u201cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\u2019ve come anywhere near here again, I\u2019ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \u201cAt least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u201d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry!\u201d she wailed. \u201cSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\u2019ve only just got away, I don\u2019t know where Snape went.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out of here tonight and I\u2019m going to try and get to the Stone first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAfter what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\u2019ll be expelled!\u201d\n\n\u201cSO WHAT?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\u2019s coming back! Haven\u2019t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\u2019t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter anymore, can\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side! I\u2019m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\u201d\n\nHe glared at them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Harry,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s just lucky I got it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it cover all three of us?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAll\u2014all three of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, you don\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione briskly. \u201cHow do you think you\u2019d get to the Stone without us? I\u2019d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\u2019re not throwing me out after that.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\u2019t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n\n\u201cBetter get the cloak,\u201d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy\u2014he didn\u2019t feel much like singing.\n\nHe ran back down to the common room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\u2014if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\u2019d been making another bid for freedom.\n\n\u201cNothing, Neville, nothing,\u201d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going out again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, Neville?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go out,\u201d said Neville, \u201cyou\u2019ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthis is important.\u201d\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you do it,\u201d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d Ron exploded, \u201cget away from that hole and don\u2019t be an idiot\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u201d said Neville. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but not to us,\u201d said Ron in exasperation. \u201cNeville, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.\n\n\u201cGo on then, try and hit me!\u201d said Neville, raising his fists. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cDo something,\u201d he said desperately.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u201d\n\nShe raised her wand.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n\nNeville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done to him?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the full Body Bind,\u201d said Hermione miserably. \u201cOh, Neville, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u201d said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\u2019s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u201d Ron whispered in Harry\u2019s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThey didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \u201cKnow you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u201d\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n\n\u201cShould call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a creeping around unseen.\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\u201d\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n\n\u201cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\u201d he said greasily. \u201cMy mistake, my mistake\u2014I didn\u2019t see you\u2014of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible\u2014forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have business here, Peeves,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cStay away from this place tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\u201d said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \u201cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u201d\n\nAnd he scooted off.\n\n\u201cBrilliant, Harry!\u201d whispered Ron.\n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third floor corridor\u2014and the door was already ajar.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d Harry said quietly, \u201cSnape\u2019s already got past Fluffy.\u201d\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can take the cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry pushed the door open.\n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that at its feet?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cLooks like a harp,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape must have left it there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, here goes\u2026\u201d\n\nHe put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\u2019s growls ceased\u2014it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n\n\u201cKeep playing,\u201d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\u2019s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u201d said Ron, peering over the dog\u2019s back. \u201cWant to go first, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n\n\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Hermione said anxiously.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2014just black\u2014there\u2019s no way of climbing down, we\u2019ll just have to drop.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\n\n\u201cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\u201d\n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cSee you in a minute, I hope\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and\u2014\n\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \u201cit\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u201d\n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff?\u201d were his first words.\n\n\u201cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\u201d\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\u2019s other side.\n\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLucky!\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cLook at you both!\u201d\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.\n\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what this is\u2014it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a great help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\n\n\u201cDevil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare\u2026 what did Professor Sprout say?\u2014it likes the dark and the damp\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo light a fire!\u201d Harry choked.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014of course\u2014but there\u2019s no wood!\u201d Hermione cried, wringing her hands.\n\n\u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u201d Ron bellowed. \u201cARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\n\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a crisis\u2014\u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully grown dragon\u2014Norbert had been bad enough\u2026\n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 sounds like wings to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead\u2014I can see something moving.\u201d\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once\u2026 well, there\u2019s no other choice\u2026 I\u2019ll run.\u201d\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThese birds\u2026 they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering\u2014glittering?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re keys! Winged keys\u2014look carefully. So that must mean\u2026\u201d he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \u201c\u2026yes\u2014look! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are hundreds of them!\u201d\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a big, old fashioned one\u2014probably silver, like the handle.\u201d\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\u2019t. After a minute\u2019s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\n\u201cThat one!\u201d he called to the others. \u201cThat big one\u2014there\u2014no, there\u2014with bright blue wings\u2014the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\u201d\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to close in on it!\u201d Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \u201cRon, you come at it from above\u2014Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\u2019ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\u201d\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned\u2014it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly\u2014the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way across the room.\u201d\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Hermione nervously.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to be chessmen.\u201d\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\u2019s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\u201cDo we\u2014er\u2014have to join you to get across?\u201d The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cThis needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\u2019ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not offended,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cJust tell us what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go next to him instead of that castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a knight,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n\n\u201cWhite always plays first in chess,\u201d said Ron, peering across the board. \u201cYes\u2026 look\u2026\u201d\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014move diagonally four squares to the right.\u201d\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.\n\n\u201cHad to let that happen,\u201d said Ron, looking shaken. \u201cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\u201d\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cLet me think\u2014let me think\u2026\u201d\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Ron softly, \u201cIt\u2019s the only way\u2026 I\u2019ve got to be taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s chess!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\u2019ll take me\u2014that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t hurry up, he\u2019ll already have the Stone!\u201d\n\nThere was no alternative.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Ron called, his face pale but determined. \u201cHere I go\u2014now, don\u2019t hang around once you\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor\u2014Hermione screamed but stayed on her square\u2014the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\u2019d been knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\u2019s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\n\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, trying to convince himself. \u201cWhat do you reckon\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare; Flitwick must\u2019ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThey had reached another door.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHarry pushed it open.\n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u201d Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \u201cCome on, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next\u2014but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\u2019t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\n\n\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\n\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n\n\n\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\u2019s left side;\n\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\n\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n\n\n\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n\n\n\n\n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis isn\u2019t magic\u2014it\u2019s logic\u2014a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t got an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be stuck in here forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut so will we, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cEverything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we know which to drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d\n\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fire\u2014toward the Stone.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough there for one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly one swallow.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\u201d\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n\n\u201cYou drink that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\u2019ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy\u2014go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\u2019m no match for him, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry\u2014what if You-Know-Who\u2019s with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I was lucky once, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry, pointing at his scar. \u201cI might get lucky again.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2014you\u2019re a great wizard, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you,\u201d said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBooks! And cleverness! There are more important things\u2014friendship and bravery and\u2014oh Harry\u2014be careful!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou drink first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou are sure which is which, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poison?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cNo\u2014but it\u2019s like ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, go, before it wears off.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck\u2014take care.\u201d\n\n\u201cGO!\u201d\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\n\n\u201cHere I come,\u201d he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\u2019t feel them\u2014for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\u2014then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there\u2014but it wasn\u2019t Snape. It wasn\u2019t even Voldemort.\n\n\n\n\n\n17. THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\n\n\n\nIt was Quirrell.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\u2019t twitching at all.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI wondered whether I\u2019d be meeting you here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought\u2014Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus?\u201d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\u2019t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \u201cYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\u2019t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take it in. This couldn\u2019t be true, it couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut Snape tried to kill me!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\u2019d have got you off that broom. I\u2019d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\u2019t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape was trying to save me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Quirrell coolly. \u201cWhy do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t do it again. Funny, really\u2026 he needn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular\u2026 and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u201d\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\u2019d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let the troll in?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls\u2014you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off\u2014and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three headed dog didn\u2019t even manage to bite Snape\u2019s leg off properly.\n\n\u201cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\u201d\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\n\u201cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\u201d Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \u201cTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like this\u2026 but he\u2019s in London\u2026 I\u2019ll be far away by the time he gets back\u2026\u201d\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\n\n\u201cI saw you and Snape in the forest\u2014\u201d he blurted out.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \u201cHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\u2019d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me\u2014as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n\n\u201cI see the Stone\u2026 I\u2019m presenting it to my master\u2026 but where is it?\u201d\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\u2019t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\n\u201cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he does,\u201d said Quirrell casually, \u201cheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\u2019t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing\u2014I thought Snape was threatening you\u2026\u201d\n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI find it hard to follow my master\u2019s instructions\u2014he is a great wizard and I am weak\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cHe is with me wherever I go,\u201d said Quirrell quietly. \u201cI met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it\u2026 Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\u201d Quirrell shivered suddenly. \u201cHe does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me\u2026 decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He\u2019d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mind was racing.\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it\u2014which means I\u2019ll see where it\u2019s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\u2019m up to?\n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\n\n\u201cUse the boy\u2026 Use the boy\u2026\u201d\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014Potter\u2014come here.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Quirrell repeated. \u201cLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nHarry walked toward him.\n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\u2019s all.\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket\u2014and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow\u2014incredibly\u2014he\u2019d gotten the Stone.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impatiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\nHarry screwed up his courage.\n\n\u201cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u201d he invented. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nQuirrell cursed again.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips.\n\n\u201cHe lies\u2026 He lies\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me the truth! What did you just see?\u201d\n\nThe high voice spoke again.\n\n\u201cLet me speak to him\u2026 face-to-face\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, you are not strong enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have strength enough\u2026 for this\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter\u2026\u201d it whispered.\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the face said. \u201cMere shadow and vapor\u2026 I have form only when I can share another\u2019s body\u2026 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds\u2026 Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks\u2026 you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest\u2026 and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own\u2026 Now\u2026 why don\u2019t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\u201d\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\u2019s legs. He stumbled backward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d snarled the face. \u201cBetter save your own life and join me\u2026 or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents\u2026 They died begging me for mercy\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted suddenly.\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.\n\n\u201cHow touching\u2026\u201d it hissed. \u201cI always value bravery\u2026 Yes, boy, your parents were brave\u2026 I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight\u2026 but your mother needn\u2019t have died\u2026 she was trying to protect you\u2026 Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \u201cSEIZE HIM!\u201d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened\u2014he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers\u2014they were blistering before his eyes.\n\n\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\u2019s neck\u2014Harry\u2019s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\n\u201cMaster, I cannot hold him\u2014my hands\u2014my hands!\u201d\n\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms\u2014Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\n\u201cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\u201d screeched Voldemort.\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face\u2014\n\n\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain\u2014his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off\u2014the pain in Harry\u2019s head was building\u2014he couldn\u2019t see\u2014he could only hear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s yells of, \u201cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d and other voices, maybe in Harry\u2019s own head, crying, \u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down\u2026 down\u2026 down\u2026\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\n\nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \u201cSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who does? Sir, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\n\u201cTokens from your friends and admirers,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have I been in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sit, the Stone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feared I might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou nearly were, I couldn\u2019t have kept him off the Stone much longer\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Stone, boy, you\u2014the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cBut your friend\u2014Nicolas Flamel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know about Nicolas?\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \u201cYou did do the thing properly, didn\u2019t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cTo one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all\u2014the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\u201d\n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2026 sir\u2014even if the Stone\u2019s gone, Vol\u2014, I mean, You-Know-Who\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\u2019s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he hasn\u2019t gone, has he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share\u2026 not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time\u2014and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \u201cSir, there are some other things I\u2019d like to know, if you can tell me\u2026 things I want to know the truth about\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d Dumbledore sighed. \u201cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\u2019ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\u201d\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n\n\u201cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day\u2026 put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older\u2026 I know you hate to hear this\u2026 when you are ready, you will know.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\u201cBut why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t realize that love as powerful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign\u2026 to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\u201d\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \u201cAnd the Invisibility Cloak\u2014do you know who sent it to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u2014your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cUseful things\u2026 your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s something else\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFire away.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirrell said Snape\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, him\u2014Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saved his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore dreamily. \u201cFunny, the way people\u2019s minds work, isn\u2019t it? Professor Snape couldn\u2019t bear being in your father\u2019s debt\u2026 I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\u2019s memory in peace\u2026\u201d\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\n\n\u201cAnd sir, there\u2019s one more thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, now, I\u2019m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\u2019s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone\u2014find it, but not use it\u2014would be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes\u2026 Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve rather lost my liking for them\u2014but I think I\u2019ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \u201cAlas! Ear wax!\u201d\n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\n\n\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Harry pleaded.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let Professor Dumbledore in\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut five minutes only.\u201d\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to\u2014Dumbledore was so worried\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s talking about it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat really happened?\u201d\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\u2019s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\u201cSo the Stone\u2019s gone?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cFlamel\u2019s just going to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that\u2014what was it?\u2014\u2018to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI always said he was off his rocker,\u201d said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to you two?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I got back all right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI brought Ron round\u2014that took a while\u2014and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall\u2014he already knew\u2014he just said, \u2018Harry\u2019s gone after him, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019 and hurtled off to the third floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he meant you to do it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cSending you your father\u2019s cloak and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione exploded, \u201cif he did\u2014I mean to say that\u2019s terrible\u2014you could have been killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\u2019s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Dumbledore\u2019s off his rocker, all right,\u201d said Ron proudly. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course\u2014you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you\u2014but the food\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\u201d she said firmly.\n\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the feast,\u201d he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \u201cI can, can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\u201d she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\u2019t realize how risky feasts could be. \u201cAnd you have another visitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014all\u2014my\u2014ruddy\u2014fault!\u201d he sobbed, his face in his hands. \u201cI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\u2019t know, an\u2019 I told him! Yeh could\u2019ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\u2019ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\u2019 made ter live as a Muggle!\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \u201cHagrid, he\u2019d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\u2019re talking about, he\u2019d have found out even if you hadn\u2019t told him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh could\u2019ve died!\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 say the name!\u201d\n\n\u201cVOLDEMORT!\u201d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \u201cI\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\u2019ve got loads\u2026\u201d\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \u201cThat reminds me. I\u2019ve got yeh a present.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\u201d said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\n\n\u201cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \u2019Course, he shoulda sacked me instead\u2014anyway, got yeh this\u2026\u201d\n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\n\n\u201cSent owls off ter all yer parents\u2019 old school friends, askin\u2019 fer photos\u2026 knew yeh didn\u2019 have any\u2026 d\u2019yeh like it?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t speak, but Hagrid understood.\n\nHarry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\u2019s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\u2019s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\n\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u201cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were\u2026 you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts\u2026\n\n\u201cNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\u201d\n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, recent events must be taken into account.\u201d\n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little.\n\n\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes\u2026\n\n\u201cFirst\u2014to Mr. Ronald Weasley\u2026\u201d\n\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n\n\u201c\u2026for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \u201cMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\u2019s giant chess set!\u201d\n\nAt last there was silence again.\n\n\u201cSecond\u2014to Miss Hermione Granger\u2026 for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u201d\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves\u2014they were a hundred points up.\n\n\u201cThird\u2014to Mr. Harry Potter\u2026\u201d said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet \u201c\u2026for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\u201d\n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points\u2014exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup\u2014if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of courage,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\u201d\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \u201cwe need a little change of decoration.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s feelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls\u2026 he would never, ever forget tonight.\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life.\n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us these,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross Station.\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\u2019t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\n\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron, \u201cboth of you\u2014I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look forward to.\u201d People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\n\n\u201cBye, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cStill famous,\u201d said Ron, grinning at him.\n\n\u201cNot where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \u201cThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!\u201d\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she wasn\u2019t pointing at Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook, Mom! I can see\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\n\u201cBusy year?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was nothing, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady, are you?\u201d\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou must be Harry\u2019s family!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cHurry up, boy, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d He walked away.\n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cSee you over the summer, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope you have\u2014er\u2014a good holiday,\u201d said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re not allowed to use magic at home. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
